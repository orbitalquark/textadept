Carg lpeg.Carg(n)\nCreates an argument capture. This pattern matches the empty string and\nproduces the value given as the nth extra argument given in the call to\n`lpeg.match`.
Cb lpeg.Cb(name)\nCreates a back capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces\nthe values produced by the most recent group capture named `name`.\n\nMost recent means the last complete outermost group capture with the given\nname. A Complete capture means that the entire pattern corresponding to the\ncapture has matched. An Outermost capture means that the capture is not\ninside another complete capture.
Cc lpeg.Cc([value, ...])\nCreates a constant capture. This pattern matches the empty string and\nproduces all given values as its captured values.
Cf lpeg.Cf(patt, func)\nCreates a fold capture. If patt produces a list of captures C1 C2 ... Cn,\nthis capture will produce the value func(...func(func(C1, C2), C3)..., Cn),\nthat is, it will fold (or accumulate, or reduce) the captures from `patt`\nusing function `func`.\n\nThis capture assumes that `patt` should produce at least one capture with at\nleast one value (of any type), which becomes the initial value of an\naccumulator. (If you need a specific initial value, you may prefix a constant\ncapture to `patt`.) For each subsequent capture, LPeg calls `func` with this\naccumulator as the first argument and all values produced by the capture as\nextra arguments; the first result from this call becomes the new value for\nthe accumulator. The final value of the accumulator becomes the captured\nvalue.\n\nAs an example, the following pattern matches a list of numbers separated by\ncommas and returns their addition:\n\n  -- matches a numeral and captures its numerical value\n  number = lpeg.R"09"^1 / tonumber\n  -- matches a list of numbers, capturing their values\n  list = number * ("," * number)^0\n  -- auxiliary function to add two numbers\n  function add (acc, newvalue) return acc + newvalue end\n  -- folds the list of numbers adding them\n  sum = lpeg.Cf(list, add)\n  -- example of use\n  print(sum:match("10,30,43"))   --> 83
Cg lpeg.Cg(patt [, name])\nCreates a group capture. It groups all values returned by `patt` into a\nsingle capture. The group may be anonymous (if no name is given) or named\nwith the given name.\n\nAn anonymous group serves to join values from several captures into a single\ncapture. A named group has a different behavior. In most situations, a named\ngroup returns no values at all. Its values are only relevant for a following\nback capture or when used inside a table capture.
Cmt lpeg.Cmt(patt, function)\nCreates a match-time capture. Unlike all other captures, this one is\nevaluated immediately when a match occurs. It forces the immediate evaluation\nof all its nested captures and then calls `function`.\n\nThe given function gets as arguments the entire subject, the current position\n(after the match of `patt`), plus any capture values produced by `patt`.\n\nThe first value returned by `function` defines how the match happens. If the\ncall returns a number, the match succeeds and the returned number becomes the\nnew current position. (Assuming a subject s and current position i, the\nreturned number must be in the range [i, len(s) + 1].) If the call returns\ntrue, the match succeeds without consuming any input. (So, to return true is\nequivalent to return i.) If the call returns false, nil, or no value, the\nmatch fails.\n\nAny extra values returned by the function become the values produced by the\ncapture.
Cp lpeg.Cp()\nCreates a position capture. It matches the empty string and captures the\nposition in the subject where the match occurs. The captured value is a\nnumber.
Cs lpeg.Cs(patt)\nCreates a substitution capture, which captures the substring of the subject\nthat matches `patt`, with substitutions. For any capture inside `patt` with a\nvalue, the substring that matched the capture is replaced by the capture\nvalue (which should be a string). The final captured value is the string\nresulting from all replacements.
Ct lpeg.Ct(patt)\nCreates a table capture. This capture creates a table and puts all values\nfrom all anonymous captures made by `patt` inside this table in successive\ninteger keys, starting at 1. Moreover, for each named capture group created\nby `patt`, the first value of the group is put into the table with the group\nname as its key. The captured value is only the table.
DEFAULT lexer.DEFAULT (string)\nThe token name for default tokens.
DEFAULT_SESSION textadept.session.DEFAULT_SESSION (string)\nThe path to the default session file, *`_USERHOME`/session*, or\n*`_USERHOME`/session_term* if `CURSES` is `true`.
DOCUTILS_PATH _M.rest.DOCUTILS_PATH (string)\nThe absolute path to the directory that contains the Python Docutils\nlibrary if it is not in the environment's `PYTHONPATH`.\nThe default value is `nil`, which indicates Docutils is installed.

S lpeg.S(string)\nReturns a pattern that matches any single character that appears in the given\nstring. (The S stands for Set.)\n\nAs an example, the pattern `lpeg.S("+-*/")` matches any arithmetic operator.\n\nNote that, if `s` is a character (that is, a string of length 1), then\n`lpeg.P(s)` is equivalent to `lpeg.S(s)` which is equivalent to\n`lpeg.R(s..s)`. Note also that both `lpeg.S("")` and `lpeg.R()` are patterns\nthat always fail.

_G _G._G (module)\nLua _G module.
_G _G._G (table)\nA global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment\n(see §2.2). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value does\nnot affect any environment, nor vice-versa.
_HOME _G._HOME (string)\nThe path to Textadept's home, or installation, directory.
_L _G._L (module)\nMap of all messages used by Textadept to their localized form.\nIf the table does not contain the localized version of a given message, it\nreturns a string that starts with "No Localization:" via a metamethod.

_cancel_current textadept.snippets._cancel_current()\nCancels the active snippet, removing all inserted text.
_fold lexer.lexer._fold (table)\nIf this function exists in the lexer, it is called for folding\n  the document instead of using `_foldsymbols` or indentation.
_foldsymbols lexer.lexer._foldsymbols (table)\nA table of recognized fold points for the lexer.\n  Keys are token names with table values defining fold points. Those table\n  values have string keys of keywords or characters that indicate a fold\n  point whose values are integers. A value of `1` indicates a beginning fold\n  point and a value of `-1` indicates an ending fold point. Values can also\n  be functions that return `1`, `-1`, or `0` (indicating no fold point) for\n  keys which need additional processing.\n  There is also a required `_pattern` key whose value is a table containing\n  Lua pattern strings that match all fold points (the string keys contained\n  in token name table values). When the lexer encounters text that matches\n  one of those patterns, the matched text is looked up in its token's table\n  to determine whether or not it is a fold point.
_insert textadept.snippets._insert(text)\nInserts snippet text *text* or the snippet assigned to the trigger word\nbehind the caret.\nOtherwise, if a snippet is active, goes to the active snippet's next\nplaceholder.

If `nil`, attempts to insert a\n  new snippet based on the trigger, the word behind caret, and the current\n  lexer.\n@return `false` if no action was taken; `nil` otherwise.\n@see buffer.word_chars
_lexer lexer.lexer._lexer (table)\nThe parent lexer object whose rules should be used. This field\n  is only necessary to disambiguate a proxy lexer that loaded parent and\n  child lexers for embedding and ended up having multiple parents loaded.
_previous textadept.snippets._previous()\nJumps back to the previous snippet placeholder, reverting any changes from\nthe current one.\nReturns `false` if no snippet is active.\n@return `false` if no snippet is active; `nil` otherwise.
_print ui._print(buffer_type, ...)\nPrints the given string messages to the buffer of type *buffer_type*.\nOpens a new buffer for printing messages to if necessary.

Message strings.\n@usage ui._print(_L['[Message Buffer]'], message)
_rules lexer.lexer._rules (table)\nAn ordered list of rules for a lexer grammar.\n  Each rule is a table containing an arbitrary rule name and the LPeg pattern\n  associated with the rule. The order of rules is important as rules are\n  matched sequentially.\n  Child lexers should not use this table to access and/or modify their\n  parent's rules and vice-versa. Use the `_RULES` table instead.
_select textadept.snippets._select()\nPrompts the user to select a snippet to be inserted from a list of global and\nlanguage-specific snippets.
_tokenstyles lexer.lexer._tokenstyles (table)\nA map of non-predefined token names to styles.\n  Remember to use token names, not rule names. It is recommended to use\n  predefined styles or color-agnostic styles derived from predefined styles\n  to ensure compatibility with user color themes.

annotation_style_offset buffer.annotation_style_offset (number)\nThe beginning of the range of style numbers used for annotations.\nAlways set this to the result of `buffer.allocate_extended_styles()`.\nAnnotation styles may be completely separated from standard text styles by\nsetting a style offset. For example, when set to `512`, annotation styles\nare numbered from `512` upto `767` so they do not overlap styles set by\nlexers (or margins if margins offset is `256`). Each style number set with\n`annotation_style` has the offset added before looking up the style.\nThe default value is `0`.
annotation_text buffer.annotation_text (table)\nTable of annotation text for line numbers starting from zero.
annotation_visible buffer.annotation_visible (number)\nThe annotation visibility mode.\n\n* `buffer.ANNOTATION_HIDDEN`\n  Annotations are invisible.\n* `buffer.ANNOTATION_STANDARD`\n  Draw annotations left-justified with no decoration.\n* `buffer.ANNOTATION_BOXED`\n  Indent annotations to match the annotated text and outline them with a\n  box.\n* `buffer.ANNOTATION_INDENTED`\n  Indent non-decorated annotations to match the annotated text.\n\nThe default value is `buffer.ANNOTATION_HIDDEN`.

Negative displacements shift to the left.\n\nThis shift operation is what is called arithmetic shift. Vacant bits on the\nleft are filled with copies of the higher bit of `x`; vacant bits on the\nright are filled with zeros. In particular, displacements with absolute\nvalues higher than 31 result in zero or `0xFFFFFFFF` (all original bits are\nshifted out).

asin math.asin(x)\nReturns the arc sine of `x` (in radians).
assert _G.assert(v [, message])\nIssues an error when the value of its argument `v` is false (i.e.,\nnil or false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. `message` is an error\nmessage; when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"
atan math.atan(x)\nReturns the arc tangent of `x` (in radians).
atan2 math.atan2(y, x)\nReturns the arc tangent of `y/x` (in radians), but uses the signs\nof both parameters to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles\ncorrectly the case of `x` being zero.)
attributes lfs.attributes(filepath [, aname])\nReturns a table with the file attributes corresponding to filepath (or nil\nfollowed by an error message in case of error). If the second optional\nargument is given, then only the value of the named attribute is returned\n(this use is equivalent to lfs.attributes(filepath).aname, but the table is\nnot created and only one attribute is retrieved from the O.S.). The\nattributes are described as follows; attribute mode is a string, all the\nothers are numbers, and the time related attributes use the same time\nreference of os.time:\n  dev: on Unix systems, this represents the device that the inode resides on.\n       On Windows systems, represents the drive number of the disk containing\n       the file\n  ino: on Unix systems, this represents the inode number. On Windows systems\n       this has no meaning\n  mode: string representing the associated protection mode (the values could\n        be file, directory, link, socket, named pipe, char device, block\n        device or other)\n  nlink: number of hard links to the file\n  uid: user-id of owner (Unix only, always 0 on Windows)\n  gid: group-id of owner (Unix only, always 0 on Windows)\n  rdev: on Unix systems, represents the device type, for special file inodes.\n        On Windows systems represents the same as dev\n  access: time of last access\n  modification: time of last data modification\n  change: time of last file status change\n  size: file size, in bytes\n  blocks: block allocated for file; (Unix only)\n  blksize: optimal file system I/O blocksize; (Unix only)\n\nThis function uses stat internally thus if the given filepath is a symbolic\nlink, it is followed (if it points to another link the chain is followed\nrecursively) and the information is about the file it refers to. To obtain\ninformation about the link itself, see function lfs.symlinkattributes.

currentdir lfs.currentdir()\nReturns a string with the current working directory or nil plus an error\nstring.
cursor buffer.cursor (number)\nThe display cursor type.\n\n* `buffer.CURSORNORMAL`\n  The text insert cursor.\n* `buffer.CURSORARROW`\n  The arrow cursor.\n* `buffer.CURSORWAIT`\n  The wait cursor.\n* `buffer.CURSORREVERSEARROW`\n  The reversed arrow cursor.\n\nThe default value is `buffer.CURSORNORMAL`.
cut buffer.cut(buffer)\nCuts the selected text to the clipboard.\nMultiple selections are copied in order with no delimiters. Rectangular\nselections are copied from top to bottom with end of line characters. Virtual\nspace is not copied.\n@param buffer A buffer.
cwd textadept.run.cwd (string, Read-only)\nThe most recently executed compile or run shell command's working\ndirectory.\nIt is used for going to error messages with relative file paths.
date os.date([format [, time]])\nReturns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according\nto the given string `format`.\n\nIf the `time` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted\n(see the `os.time` function for a description of this value). Otherwise,\n`date` formats the current time.\n\nIf `format` starts with '`!`', then the date is formatted in Coordinated\nUniversal Time. After this optional character, if `format` is the string\n"`*t`", then `date` returns a table with the following fields: `year` (four\ndigits), `month` (1-12), `day` (1-31), `hour` (0-23), `min` (0-59), `sec`\n(0-61), `wday` (weekday, Sunday is 1), `yday` (day of the year), and `isdst`\n(daylight saving flag, a boolean). This last field may be absent if the\ninformation is not available.\n\nIf `format` is not "`*t`", then `date` returns the date as a string,\nformatted according to the same rules as the ANSI C function `strftime`.\n\nWhen called without arguments, `date` returns a reasonable date and time\nrepresentation that depends on the host system and on the current locale\n(that is, `os.date()` is equivalent to `os.date("%c")`).\n\nOn non-Posix systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its\nreliance on C function `gmtime` and C function `localtime`.
debug _G.debug (module)\nLua debug module.
debug debug.debug()\nEnters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that\nthe user enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities,\nthe user can inspect global and local variables, change their values,\nevaluate expressions, and so on. A line containing only the word `cont`\nfinishes this function, so that the caller continues its execution.\n\nNote that commands for `debug.debug` are not lexically nested within any\nfunction and so have no direct access to local variables.

delete_range buffer.delete_range(buffer, pos, length)\nDeletes the range of text from position *pos* to *pos* + *length*.\n@param buffer A buffer.\n@param pos The start position of the range of text in *buffer* to delete.\n@param length The number of characters in the range of text to delete.
delimited_range lexer.delimited_range(chars, single_line, no_escape, balanced)\nCreates and returns a pattern that matches a range of text bounded by\n*chars* characters.\nThis is a convenience function for matching more complicated delimited ranges\nlike strings with escape characters and balanced parentheses. *single_line*\nindicates whether or not the range must be on a single line, *no_escape*\nindicates whether or not to ignore '\' as an escape character, and *balanced*\nindicates whether or not to handle balanced ranges like parentheses and\nrequires *chars* to be composed of two characters.\n@param chars The character(s) that bound the matched range.\n@param single_line Optional flag indicating whether or not the range must be\n  on a single line.\n@param no_escape Optional flag indicating whether or not the range end\n  character may be escaped by a '\\' character.\n@param balanced Optional flag indicating whether or not to match a balanced\n  range, like the "%b" Lua pattern. This flag only applies if *chars*\n  consists of two different characters (e.g. "()").\n@usage local dq_str_escapes = l.delimited_range('"')\n@usage local dq_str_noescapes = l.delimited_range('"', false, true)\n@usage local unbalanced_parens = l.delimited_range('()')\n@usage local balanced_parens = l.delimited_range('()', false, false, true)\n@return pattern\n@see nested_pair

dir lfs.dir(path)\nLua iterator over the entries of a given directory. Each time the iterator is\ncalled with dir_obj it returns a directory entry's name as a string, or nil\nif there are no more entries. You can also iterate by calling dir_obj:next(),\nand explicitly close the directory before the iteration finished with\ndir_obj:close(). Raises an error if path is not a directory.
dir_foreach lfs.dir_foreach(dir, f, filter, exclude_FILTER, n, include_dirs, level)\nIterates over all files and sub-directories (up to level number *n*) in\ndirectory *dir*, calling function *f* with each file found.\nFiles passed to *f* do not match any pattern in string or table *filter*,\nand, unless *exclude_FILTER* is `true`, `lfs.FILTER` as well. A filter table\ncontains Lua patterns that match filenames to exclude, an optional `folders`\nsub-table that contains patterns matching directories to exclude, and an\noptional `extensions` sub-table that contains raw file extensions to exclude.\nAny patterns starting with '!' exclude files and directories that do not\nmatch the pattern that follows.\n@param dir The directory path to iterate over.\n@param f Function to call with each full file path found. If *f* returns\n  `false` explicitly, iteration ceases.\n@param filter Optional filter for files and directories to exclude.\n@param exclude_FILTER Optional flag indicating whether or not to exclude the\n  default filter `lfs.FILTER` in the search. If `false`, adds `lfs.FILTER` to\n  *filter*.\n  The default value is `false` to include the default filter.\n@param n Optional maximum number of directory levels to descend into.\n  The default value is `nil`, which indicates no limit.\n@param include_dirs Optional flag indicating whether or not to call *f* with\n  directory names too. Directory names are passed with a trailing '/' or '\',\n  depending on the current platform.\n  The default value is `false`.\n@param level Utility value indicating the directory level this function is\n  at. This value is used and set internally, and should not be set otherwise.\n@see FILTER

The default\n    value is `1`.\n  * `string_output`: Return the selected button's label (instead of its\n    index) and the selected item's text (instead of its index). If no item\n    was selected, returns the dialog's exit status (instead of its exit\n    code). The default value is `false`.\n  * `width`: The dialog's pixel width.\n  * `height`: The dialog's pixel height.\n  * `float`: Show the dialog on top of all desktop windows.

error _G.error(message [, level])\nTerminates the last protected function called and returns `message`\nas the error message. Function `error` never returns.\n\nUsually, `error` adds some information about the error position at the\nbeginning of the message, if the message is a string. The `level` argument\nspecifies how to get the error position. With level 1 (the default), the\nerror position is where the `error` function was called. Level 2 points the\nerror to where the function that called `error` was called; and so on.\nPassing a level 0 avoids the addition of error position information to the\nmessage.
error_patterns textadept.run.error_patterns (table)\nList of warning and error string patterns that match various compile and run\nwarnings and errors.\nPatterns contain filename, line number, and optional warning or error message\ncaptures for single lines. When a warning or error message is double-clicked,\nthe user is taken to the point of warning/error.\nWhen adding to this list, use `(.-)` to match filenames and `(%d+)` to match\nline numbers. Also keep in mind that patterns are matched in sequential\norder; once a pattern matches, no more are tried.
events _G.events (module)\nTextadept's core event structure and handlers.
execute os.execute([command])\nThis function is equivalent to the ANSI C function `system`. It passes\n`command` to be executed by an operating system shell. Its first result is\n`true` if the command terminated successfully, or `nil` otherwise. After this\nfirst result the function returns a string and a number, as follows:\n  "exit": the command terminated normally; the following number is the exit\n          status of the command.\n  "signal": the command was terminated by a signal; the following number is\n            the signal that terminated the command.\n\nWhen called without a `command`, `os.execute` returns a boolean that is true\nif a shell is available.
exit os.exit([code [, close]])\nCalls the ANSI C function `exit` to terminate the host program. If `code` is\n`true`, the returned status is `EXIT_SUCCESS`; if `code` is `false`, the\nreturned status is `EXIT_FAILURE`; if `code` is a number, the returned status\nis this number. The default value for `code` is `true`.\n\nIf the optional second argument `close` is true, closes the Lua state before\nexiting.

find string.find(s, pattern [, init [, plain]])\nLooks for the first match of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds a\nmatch, then `find` returns the indices of `s` where this occurrence starts\nand ends; otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numerical argument\n`init` specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and\ncan be negative. A value of true as a fourth, optional argument `plain`\nturns off the pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain\n"find substring" operation, with no characters in `pattern` being considered\nmagic. Note that if `plain` is given, then `init` must be given as well.\n\nIf the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values\nare also returned, after the two indices.

format string.format(formatstring, ···)\nReturns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the\ndescription given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format\nstring follows the same rules as the ANSI C function `sprintf`. The only\ndifferences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `h`, `L`, `l`, `n`, and `p`\nare not supported and that there is an extra option, `q`. The `q` option\nformats a string between double quotes, using escape sequences when necessary\nto ensure that it can safely be read back by the Lua interpreter. For\ninstance, the call\n\n  string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')\n\nmay produce the string:\n\n  "a string with \"quotes\" and \\n      new line"\n\nOptions `A` and `a` (when available), `E`, `e`, `f`, `G`, and `g` all expect\na number as argument. Options `c`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x` also\nexpect a number, but the range of that number may be limited by the\nunderlying C implementation. For options `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x`, the number\ncannot be negative. Option `q` expects a string; option `s` expects a string\nwithout embedded zeros. If the argument to option `s` is not a string, it is\nconverted to one following the same rules of `tostring`.
frexp math.frexp(x)\nReturns `m` and `e` such that 'x = m2^e', `e` is an integer and the\nabsolute value of `m` is in the range *[0.5, 1)* (or zero when `x` is zero).

get_split_table ui.get_split_table()\nReturns a split table that contains Textadept's current split view structure.\nThis is primarily used in session saving.\n@return table of split views. Each split view entry is a table with 4\n  fields: `1`, `2`, `vertical`, and `size`. `1` and `2` have values of either\n  nested split view entries or the views themselves; `vertical` is a flag\n  that indicates if the split is vertical or not; and `size` is the integer\n  position of the split resizer.

getenv os.getenv(varname)\nReturns the value of the process environment variable `varname`, or\nnil if the variable is not defined.
gethook debug.gethook([thread])\nReturns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the\ncurrent hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count\n(as set by the `debug.sethook` function).
getinfo debug.getinfo([thread, ] f [, what])\nReturns a table with information about a function. You can give the\nfunction directly or you can give a number as the value of `f`, which means\nthe function running at level `f` of the call stack of the given thread:\nlevel 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself); level 1 is the function\nthat called `getinfo` and so on. If `f` is a number larger than the number of\nactive functions, then `getinfo` returns nil.\n\nThe returned table can contain all the fields returned by `lua_getinfo`,\nwith the string `what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for\n`what` is to get all information available, except the table of valid\nlines. If present, the option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with\nthe function itself. If present, the option '`L`' adds a field named\n`activelines` with the table of valid lines.\n\nFor instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name` returns a table\nwith a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found,\nand the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with all available\ninformation about the `print` function.
getlocal debug.getlocal([thread, ] f, local)\nThis function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index\n`local` of the function at level `f` of the stack. This function accesses not\nonly explicit local variables, but also parameters, temporaries, etc.\n\nThe first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last\nactive variable. Negative indices refer to vararg parameters; -1 is the first\nvararg parameter. The function returns nil if there is no variable with the\ngiven index, and raises an error when called with a level out of range. (You\ncan call `debug.getinfo` to check whether the level is valid.)\n\nVariable names starting with '`(`' (open parenthesis) represent internal\nvariables (loop control variables, temporaries, varargs, and C function\nlocals).\n\nThe parameter `f` may also be a function. In that case, `getlocal` returns\nonly the name of function parameters.
getmetatable _G.getmetatable(object)\nIf `object` does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the\nobject's metatable has a `"__metatable"` field, returns the associated\nvalue. Otherwise, returns the metatable of the given object.
getmetatable debug.getmetatable(value)\nReturns the metatable of the given `value` or nil if it does not have\na metatable.
getregistry debug.getregistry()\nReturns the registry table (see §4.5).
getupvalue debug.getupvalue(f, up)\nThis function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index\n`up` of the function `f`. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue\nwith the given index.
getuservalue debug.getuservalue(u)\nReturns the Lua value associated to `u`. If `u` is not a userdata, returns\nnil.
gmatch string.gmatch(s, pattern)\nReturns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the\nnext captures from `pattern` over the string `s`. If `pattern` specifies no\ncaptures, then the whole match is produced in each call.\n\nAs an example, the following loop will iterate over all the words from string\n`s`, printing one per line:\n\n  s = "hello world from Lua"\n  for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do\n    print(w)\n  end\n\nThe next example collects all pairs `key=value` from the given string into a\ntable:\n\n  t = {}\n  s = "from=world, to=Lua"\n  for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do\n    t[k] = v\n  end\n\nFor this function, a caret '`^`' at the start of a pattern does not work as\nan anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.
goto_anchor _M.yaml.goto_anchor()\nJumps to the anchor for the alias underneath the caret.
goto_buffer view.goto_buffer(view, n, relative)\nSwitches to buffer number *n* in the view.\n*relative* indicates whether or not *n* is an index relative to the current\nbuffer's index in `_BUFFERS` instead of an absolute index.\nEmits `BUFFER_BEFORE_SWITCH` and `BUFFER_AFTER_SWITCH` events.\n@param view The view to switch buffers in.\n@param n A relative or absolute buffer index in `_BUFFERS`. An absolute index\n  of `-1` goes to the last buffer.\n@param relative Optional flag indicating whether *n* is a relative or\n  absolute index.

goto_file ui.goto_file(filename, split, preferred_view, sloppy)\nSwitches to the existing view whose buffer's filename is *filename*.\nIf no view was found and *split* is `true`, splits the current view in order\nto show the requested file. If *split* is `false`, shifts to the next or\n*preferred_view* view in order to show the requested file. If *sloppy* is\n`true`, requires only the last part of *filename* to match a buffer's\n`filename`. If the requested file was not found, it is opened in the desired\nview.\n@param filename The filename of the buffer to go to.\n@param split Optional flag that indicates whether or not to open the buffer\n  in a split view if there is only one view. The default value is `false`.\n@param preferred_view Optional view to open the desired buffer in if the\n  buffer is not visible in any other view.\n@param sloppy Optional flag that indicates whether or not to not match\n  *filename* to `buffer.filename` exactly. When `true`, matches *filename* to\n  only the last part of `buffer.filename` This is useful for run and compile\n  commands which output relative filenames and paths instead of full ones and\n  it is likely that the file in question is already open. The default value\n  is `false`.
goto_file_found ui.find.goto_file_found(line, next)\nJumps to the source of the find in files search result on line number *line*\nin the buffer titled "Files Found" or, if *line* is `nil`, jumps to the next\nor previous search result, depending on boolean *next*.\n@param line The line number in the files found buffer that contains the\n  search result to go to.\n@param next Optional flag indicating whether to go to the next search result\n  or the previous one. Only applicable when *line* is `nil` or `false`.
goto_line buffer.goto_line(buffer, line)\nMoves the caret to the beginning of line number *line* and scrolls it into\nview.\n@param buffer A buffer.\n@param line The line number in *buffer* to go to.
goto_line textadept.editing.goto_line(line)\nMoves the caret to the beginning of line number *line* or the user-specified\nline, ensuring *line* is visible.\n@param line Optional line number to go to. If `nil`, the user is prompted for\n  one.
goto_mark textadept.bookmarks.goto_mark(next)\nPrompts the user to select a bookmarked line to move the caret to the\nbeginning of unless *next* is given.\nIf *next* is `true` or `false`, moves the caret to the beginning of the next\nor previously bookmarked line, respectively.\n@param next Optional flag indicating whether to go to the next or previous\n  bookmarked line relative to the current line. The default value is `nil`,\n  prompting the user for a bookmarked line to go to.

goto_section _M.rest.goto_section()\nPrompts the user to select a section title to jump to.\nRequires the entire document to be styled.
goto_view ui.goto_view(n, relative)\nShifts to view number *n*.\n*relative* indicates whether or not *n* is an index relative to the current\nview's index in `_VIEWS` instead of an absolute index.\nEmits `VIEW_BEFORE_SWITCH` and `VIEW_AFTER_SWITCH` events.\n@param n A relative or absolute view index in `_VIEWS`.\n@param relative Optional flag that indicates whether *n* is a relative or\n  absolute index. The default value is `false`, for an absolute index.\n@see _G._VIEWS\n@see events.VIEW_BEFORE_SWITCH\n@see events.VIEW_AFTER_SWITCH
graph lexer.graph (pattern)\nA pattern that matches any graphical character ('!' to '~').
gsub string.gsub(s, pattern, repl [, n])\nReturns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given)\noccurrences of the `pattern` have been replaced by a replacement string\nspecified by `repl`, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub`\nalso returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred.\nThe name `gsub` comes from "Global SUBstitution".\n\nIf `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character\n`%` works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `%d`,\nwith `d` between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the `d`-th captured\nsubstring. The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The sequence `%%`\nstands for a single `%`.\n\nIf `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using\nthe first capture as the key.\n\nIf `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match\noccurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.\n\nIn any case, if the pattern specifies no captures, then it behaves as if the\nwhole pattern was inside a capture.\n\nIf the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a\nstring or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise,\nif it is false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original\nmatch is kept in the string).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n  x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")\n  --> x="hello hello world world"\n  x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)\n  --> x="hello hello world"\n  x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")\n  --> x="world hello Lua from"\n  x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)\n  --> x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"\n  x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)\n        return load(s)()\n      end)\n  --> x="4+5 = 9"\n  local t = {name="lua", version="5.2"}\n  x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)\n  --> x="lua-5.2.tar.gz"

When called with a file\nhandle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When\ncalled without parameters, it returns the current default input file.\n\nIn case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an\nerror code.
inputbox ui.dialogs.inputbox(options)\nPrompts the user with an inputbox dialog defined by dialog options table\n*options*, returning the selected button's index along with the user's\ninput text (the latter as a string or table, depending on the type of\n*options*.`informative_text`).\nIf *options*.`string_output` is `true`, returns the selected button's label\nalong with the user's input text.\nIf the dialog timed out, returns `0` or `"timeout"`.

The default value is `false`.\n  * `width`: The dialog's pixel width.\n  * `height`: The dialog's pixel height.\n  * `float`: Show the dialog on top of all desktop windows. The default value\n    is `false`.\n  * `timeout`: the integer number of seconds the dialog waits for the user to\n    select a button before timing out. Dialogs do not time out by default.\n@usage ui.dialogs.inputbox{title = 'Goto Line', informative_text = 'Line:',\n  text = '1'}\n@return selected button or exit code, input text
insert table.insert(list, [pos, ] value)\nInserts element `value` at position `pos` in `list`, shifting up the elements\n`list[pos], list[pos+1], ···, list[#list]`. The default value for `pos` is\n`#list+1`, so that a call `table.insert(t,x)` inserts `x` at the end of list\n`t`.
insert_text buffer.insert_text(buffer, pos, text)\nInserts string *text* at position *pos*, removing any selections.\nIf *pos* is `-1`, inserts *text* at the caret position.\nIf the caret is after the *pos*, it is moved appropriately, but not scrolled\ninto view.\n@param buffer A buffer.\n@param pos The position in *buffer* to insert text at, or `-1` for the\n  current position.\n@param text The text to insert.

lines file:lines(···)\nReturns an iterator function that, each time it is called, reads the file\naccording to the given formats. When no format is given, uses "*l" as a\ndefault. As an example, the construction\n\n  for c in file:lines(1) do <em>body</em> end\n\nwill iterate over all characters of the file, starting at the current\nposition. Unlike `io.lines`, this function does not close the file when the\nloop ends.\n\nIn case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an\nerror code.
lines io.lines([filename ···])\nOpens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that\nworks like `file:lines(···)` over the opened file. When the iterator function\ndetects -- the end of file, it returns nil (to finish the loop) and\nautomatically closes the file.\n\nThe call `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to\n`io.input():lines()`; that is, it iterates over the lines of the default\ninput file. In this case it does not close the file when the loop ends.\n\nIn case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an\nerror code.
lines_join buffer.lines_join(buffer)\nJoins the lines in the target range, inserting spaces between the words\njoined at line boundaries.\n@param buffer A buffer.
lines_on_screen buffer.lines_on_screen (number, Read-only)\nThe number of completely visible lines in the view.\nIt is possible to have a partial line visible at the bottom of the view.

When `0`, uses the width of\n  the view.
load _G.load(ld [, source [, mode [, env]]])\nLoads a chunk.\n\nIf `ld` is a string, the chunk is this string. If `ld` is a function, `load`\ncalls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to `ld` must return a\nstring that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string,\nnil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.\n\nIf there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function;\notherwise, returns <b>nil</b> plus the error message.\n\nIf the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value\nof `env`, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global\nenvironment. (When you load a main chunk, the resulting function will always\nhave exactly one upvalue, the `_ENV` variable (see §2.2). When you load a\nbinary chunk created from a function (see `string.dump`), the resulting\nfunction can have arbitrary upvalues.)\n\n`source` is used as the source of the chunk for error messages and debug\ninformation (see §4.9). When absent, it defaults to `ld`, if `ld` is a\nstring, or to "`=(load)`" otherwise.\n\nThe string `mode` controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is,\na precompiled chunk). It may be the string "`b`" (only binary chunks), "`t`"\n(only text chunks), or "`bt`" (both binary and text). The default is "`bt`".
load lexer.load(name, alt_name)\nInitializes or loads and returns the lexer of string name *name*.\nScintilla calls this function to load a lexer. Parent lexers also call this\nfunction to load child lexers and vice-versa. The user calls this function\nto load a lexer when using Scintillua as a Lua library.\n@param name The name of the lexing language.\n@param alt_name The alternate name of the lexing language. This is useful for\n  embedding the same child lexer with multiple sets of start and end tokens.\n@return lexer object
load textadept.session.load(filename)\nLoads session file *filename* or the user-selected session, returning `true`\nif a session file was opened and read.\nTextadept restores split views, opened buffers, cursor information, and\nrecent files.\n@param filename Optional absolute path to the session file to load. If `nil`,\n  the user is prompted for one.\n@usage textadept.session.load(filename)\n@return `true` if the session file was opened and read; `false` otherwise.\n@see DEFAULT_SESSION
loaded package.loaded (table)\nA table used by `require` to control which modules are already loaded. When\nyou require a module `modname` and `package.loaded[modname]` is not false,\n`require` simply returns the value stored there.\nThis variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this\nvariable do not change the table used by `require`.
loadfile _G.loadfile([filename [, mode [, env]]])\nSimilar to `load`, but gets the chunk from file `filename` or from the\nstandard input, if no file name is given.
loadlib package.loadlib(libname, funcname)\nDynamically links the host program with the C library `libname`.\n\nIf `funcname` is "`*`", then it only links with the library, making the\nsymbols exported by the library available to other dynamically linked\nlibraries. Otherwise, it looks for a function `funcname` inside the library\nand returns this function as a C function. So, `funcname` must follow the\n`lua_CFunction` prototype (see `lua_CFunction`).\n\nThis is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module\nsystem. Unlike `require`, it does not perform any path searching and does\nnot automatically adds extensions. `libname` must be the complete file name\nof the C library, including if necessary a path and an extension. `funcname`\nmust be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the\nC compiler and linker used).\n\nThis function is not supported by Standard C. As such, it is only available\non some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix\nsystems that support the `dlfcn` standard).
locale lpeg.locale([table])\nReturns a table with patterns for matching some character classes according\nto the current locale. The table has fields named `alnum`, `alpha`, `cntrl`,\n`digit`, `graph`, `lower`, `print`, `punct`, `space`, `upper`, and `xdigit`,\neach one containing a correspondent pattern. Each pattern matches any single\ncharacter that belongs to its class.\n\nIf called with an argument `table`, then it creates those fields inside the\ngiven table and returns that table.
lock lfs.lock(filehandle, mode[, start[, length]])\nLocks a file or a part of it. This function works on open files; the file\nhandle should be specified as the first argument. The string mode could be\neither r (for a read/shared lock) or w (for a write/exclusive lock). The\noptional arguments start and length can be used to specify a starting point\nand its length; both should be numbers.\n\nReturns true if the operation was successful; in case of error, it returns\nnil plus an error string.
lock_dir lfs.lock_dir(path, [seconds_stale])\nCreates a lockfile (called lockfile.lfs) in path if it does not exist and\nreturns the lock. If the lock already exists checks it it's stale, using the\nsecond parameter (default for the second parameter is INT_MAX, which in\npractice means the lock will never be stale. To free the the lock call\nlock:free().\n\nIn case of any errors it returns nil and the error message. In particular,\nif the lock exists and is not stale it returns the "File exists" message.
log math.log(x [, base])\nReturns the logarithm of `x` in the given base. The default for `base` is 'e'\n(so that the function returns the natural logarithm of `x`).
lower lexer.lower (pattern)\nA pattern that matches any lower case character ('a'-'z').
lower string.lower(s)\nReceives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase\nletters changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The\ndefinition of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.
lower_case buffer.lower_case(buffer)\nConverts the selected text to lower case letters.\n@param buffer A buffer.
lpeg _G.lpeg (module)\nLua lpeg module.
lrotate bit32.lrotate(x, disp)\nReturns the number `x` rotated `disp` bits to the left. The number `disp` may\nbe any representable integer.\n\nFor any valid displacement, the following identity holds:\n\n  assert(bit32.lrotate(x, disp) == bit32.lrotate(x, disp % 32))\n\nIn particular, negative displacements rotate to the right.
lshift bit32.lshift(x, disp)\nReturns the number `x` shifted `disp` bits to the left. The number `disp` may\nbe any representable integer. Negative displacements shift to the right. In\nany direction, vacant bits are filled with zeros. In particular,\ndisplacements with absolute values higher than 31 result in zero (all bits\nare shifted out).\n\nFor positive displacements, the following equality holds:\n\n  assert(bit32.lshift(b, disp) == (b * 2^disp) % 2^32)

match lpeg.match(pattern, subject [, init])\nThe matching function. It attempts to match the given pattern against the\nsubject string. If the match succeeds, returns the index in the subject of\nthe first character after the match, or the captured values (if the pattern\ncaptured any value).\n\nAn optional numeric argument `init` makes the match start at that position in\nthe subject string. As usual in Lua libraries, a negative value counts from\nthe end.\n\nUnlike typical pattern-matching functions, match works only in anchored mode;\nthat is, it tries to match the pattern with a prefix of the given subject\nstring (at position `init`), not with an arbitrary substring of the subject.\nSo, if we want to find a pattern anywhere in a string, we must either write a\nloop in Lua or write a pattern that matches anywhere. This second approach is\neasy and quite efficient; see examples.
match string.match(s, pattern [, init])\nLooks for the first *match* of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it\nfinds one, then `match` returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise\nit returns nil. If `pattern` specifies no captures, then the whole match\nis returned. A third, optional numerical argument `init` specifies where\nto start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative.

This\nmeans that any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `pcall` catches\nthe error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a\nboolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case,\n`pcall` also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In\ncase of any error, `pcall` returns false plus the error message.

read file:read(···)\nReads the file `file`, according to the given formats, which specify\nwhat to read. For each format, the function returns a string (or a number)\nwith the characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified\nformat. When called without formats, it uses a default format that reads\nthe next line (see below).\n\nThe available formats are\n  "*n": reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number\n        instead of a string.\n  "*a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position.

remove table.remove(list [, pos])\nRemoves from `list` the element at position `pos`, returning the value of the\nremoved element. When `pos` is an integer between 1 and `#list`, it shifts\ndown the elements `list[pos+1], list[pos+2], ···, list[#list]` and erases\nelement `list[#list]`; The index `pos` can also be 0 when `#list` is 0, or\n`#list + 1`; in those cases, the function erases the element `list[pos]`.\n\nThe default value for `pos` is `#list`, so that a call `table.remove(t)`\nremoves the last element of list `t`.
rename os.rename(oldname, newname)\nRenames file or directory named `oldname` to `newname`. If this function\nfails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and the error code.

replace_target_re buffer.replace_target_re(buffer, text)\nReplaces the text in the target range with string *text* but first replaces\nany "\d" sequences with the text of capture number *d* from the regular\nexpression (or the entire match for *d* = 0), and then returns the\nreplacement text's length.\n@param buffer A buffer.\n@param text The text to replace the target range with.\n@return number
representation buffer.representation (table)\nThe alternative string representations of characters.\nRepresentations are displayed in the same way control characters are. Use\nthe empty string for the '\0' character when assigning its representation.\nCall `buffer.clear_representation()` to remove a representation.
require _G.require(modname)\nLoads the given module. The function starts by looking into the\n`package.loaded` table to determine whether `modname` is already\nloaded. If it is, then `require` returns the value stored at\n`package.loaded[modname]`. Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader* for\nthe module.\n\nTo find a loader, `require` is guided by the `package.searchers` sequence. By\nchanging this sequence, we can change how `require` looks for a module. The\nfollowing explanation is based on the default configuration for\n`package.searchers`.\n\nFirst `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it has a value,\nthis value (which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise `require`\nsearches for a Lua loader using the path stored in `package.path`. If\nthat also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in\n`package.cpath`. If that also fails, it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see\n`package.searchers`).\n\nOnce a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with two arguments:\n`modname` and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the\nloader came from a file, this extra value is the file name.) If the loader\nreturns any non-nil value, `require` assigns the returned value to\n`package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader does not return a non-nil value and\nhas not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then `require`\nassigns <b>true</b> to this entry. In any case, `require` returns the final\nvalue of `package.loaded[modname]`.\n\nIf there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find\nany loader for the module, then `require` raises an error.
reset _G.reset()\nResets the Lua state by reloading all initialization scripts.\nLanguage modules for opened files are NOT reloaded. Re-opening the files that\nuse them will reload those modules instead.\nThis function is useful for modifying user scripts (such as\n*~/.textadept/init.lua* and *~/.textadept/modules/textadept/keys.lua*) on\nthe fly without having to restart Textadept. `arg` is set to `nil` when\nreinitializing the Lua State. Any scripts that need to differentiate between\nstartup and reset can test `arg`.

resume coroutine.resume(co [, val1, ···])\nStarts or continues the execution of coroutine `co`. The first time\nyou resume a coroutine, it starts running its body. The values `val1`,\n... are passed as the arguments to the body function. If the coroutine\nhas yielded, `resume` restarts it; the values `val1`, ... are passed\nas the results from the yield.\n\nIf the coroutine runs without any errors, `resume` returns true plus any\nvalues passed to `yield` (if the coroutine yields) or any values returned\nby the body function (if the coroutine terminates). If there is any error,\n`resume` returns false plus the error message.
reverse string.reverse(s)\nReturns a string that is the string `s` reversed.
rgba_image_height buffer.rgba_image_height (number)\nThe height of the RGBA image to be defined using\n`buffer.marker_define_rgba_image()`.
rgba_image_scale buffer.rgba_image_scale (number)\nThe scale factor in percent of the RGBA image to be defined using\n`buffer.marker_define_rgba_image()`.\nThis is useful on OSX with a retina display where each display unit is 2\npixels: use a factor of `200` so that each image pixel is displayed using a\nscreen pixel. The default scale, `100`, will stretch each image pixel to\ncover 4 screen pixels on a retina display.
rgba_image_width buffer.rgba_image_width (number)\nThe width of the RGBA image to be defined using\n`buffer.marker_define_rgba_image()` and\n`buffer.register_rgba_image()`.

rotate_selection buffer.rotate_selection(buffer)\nDesignates the next additional selection to be the main selection.\n@param buffer A buffer.
rrotate bit32.rrotate(x, disp)\nReturns the number `x` rotated `disp` bits to the right. The number `disp`\nmay be any representable integer.\n\nFor any valid displacement, the following identity holds:\n\n  assert(bit32.rrotate(x, disp) == bit32.rrotate(x, disp % 32))\n\nIn particular, negative displacements rotate to the left.
rshift bit32.rshift(x, disp)\nReturns the number `x` shifted `disp` bits to the right. The number `disp`\nmay be any representable integer. Negative displacements shift to the left.\nIn any direction, vacant bits are filled with zeros. In particular,\ndisplacements with absolute values higher than 31 result in zero (all bits\nare shifted out).\n\nFor positive displacements, the following equality holds:\n\n  assert(bit32.rshift(b, disp) == math.floor(b % 2^32 / 2^disp))\n\nThis shift operation is what is called logical shift.

searchers package.searchers (table)\nA table used by `require` to control how to load modules.\nEach entry in this table is a *searcher function*. When looking for a\nmodule, `require` calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with\nthe module name (the argument given to `require`) as its sole parameter.\nThe function can return another function (the module *loader*) plus an\nextra value that will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why\nit did not find that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).\nLua initializes this table with four functions.\nThe first searcher simply looks for a loader in the `package.preload`\ntable.\nThe second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path\nstored at `package.path`. The search is done as described in function\n`package.searchpath`.\nThe third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given\nby the variable `package.cpath`. Again, the search is done as described in\nfunction `package.searchpath`. For instance, if the C path is the string\n  "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"\nthe searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`,\n`./foo.dll`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order. Once it finds\na C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the\napplication with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the\nlibrary to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string\n"`luaopen_`" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot\nis replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen,\nits prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance,\nif the module name is `a.v1-b.c`, the function name will be `luaopen_b_c`.\nThe fourth searcher tries an *all-in-one loader*. It searches the C\npath for a library for the root name of the given module. For instance,\nwhen requiring `a.b.c`, it will search for a C library for `a`. If found,\nit looks into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example,\nthat would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With this facility, a package can pack\nseveral C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping\nits original open function.\nAll searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the\nfile name where the module was found, as returned by `package.searchpath`.\nThe first searcher returns no extra value.
searchpath package.searchpath(name, path [, sep [, rep]])\nSearches for the given `name` in the given `path`.\n\nA path is a string containing a sequence of _templates_ separated by\nsemicolons. For each template, the function replaces each interrogation mark\n(if any) in the template with a copy of `name` wherein all occurrences of\n`sep` (a dot, by default) were replaced by `rep` (the system's directory\nseparator, by default), and then tries to open the resulting file name.\nFor instance, if the path is the string\n  "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"\nthe search for the name `foo.a` will try to open the files `./foo/a.lua`,\n`./foo/a.lc`, and `/usr/local/foo/a/init.lua`, in that order.\nReturns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read mode\n(after closing the file), or nil plus an error message if none succeeds.\n(This error message lists all file names it tried to open.)
secure_inputbox ui.dialogs.secure_inputbox(options)\nPrompts the user with a masked inputbox dialog defined by dialog options\ntable *options*, returning the selected button's index along with the user's\ninput text (the latter as a string or table, depending on the type of\n*options*.`informative_text`).\nIf *options*.`string_output` is `true`, returns the selected button's label\nalong with the user's input text.\nIf the dialog timed out, returns `0` or `"timeout"`.

Providing a\n    single label has no effect.\n  * `text`: The dialog's initial input text. If the value is a table, the\n    table values are used to populate the multiple entry boxes defined by\n    `informative_text`.\n  * `button1`: The right-most button's label. The default value is\n    `_L['_OK']`.\n  * `button2`: The middle button's label.\n  * `button3`: The left-most button's label.

seek file:seek([whence [, offset]])\nSets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the\nfile, to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the string\n`whence`, as follows:\n  "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);\n  "cur": base is current position;\n  "end": base is end of file;\n\nIn case of success, function `seek` returns the final file position,\nmeasured in bytes from the beginning of the file. If `seek` fails, it returns\nnil, plus a string describing the error.\n\nThe default value for `whence` is `"cur"`, and for `offset` is 0. Therefore,\nthe call `file:seek()` returns the current file position, without changing\nit; the call `file:seek("set")` sets the position to the beginning of the\nfile (and returns 0); and the call `file:seek("end")` sets the position\nto the end of the file, and returns its size.

sethook debug.sethook([thread, ] hook, mask [, count])\nSets the given function as a hook. The string `mask` and the number\n`count` describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have\nthe following characters, with the given meaning:\n  "c": the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;\n  "r": the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;\n  "l": the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.\n\nWith a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every `count`\ninstructions.\n\nWhen called without arguments, `debug.sethook` turns off the hook.\n\nWhen the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing\nthe event that has triggered its call: `"call"` (or `"tail call"`),\n`"return"`, `"line"`, and `"count"`. For line events, the hook also gets the\nnew line number as its second parameter. Inside a hook, you can call\n`getinfo` with level 2 to get more information about the running function\n(level 0 is the `getinfo` function, and level 1 is the hook function).
setlocal debug.setlocal([thread, ] level, local, value)\nThis function assigns the value `value` to the local variable with\nindex `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. The function\nreturns nil if there is no local variable with the given index, and raises\nan error when called with a `level` out of range. (You can call `getinfo`\nto check whether the level is valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of\nthe local variable.\n\nSee `debug.getlocal` for more information about variable indices and names.
setlocale os.setlocale(locale [, category])\nSets the current locale of the program. `locale` is a system-dependent string\nspecifying a locale; `category` is an optional string describing which\ncategory to change: `"all"`, `"collate"`, `"ctype"`, `"monetary"`,\n`"numeric"`, or `"time"`; the default category is `"all"`. The function\nreturns the name of the new locale, or nil if the request cannot be honored.\n\nIf `locale` is the empty string, the current locale is set to an\nimplementation-defined native locale. If `locale` is the string "`C`",\nthe current locale is set to the standard C locale.\n\nWhen called with nil as the first argument, this function only returns\nthe name of the current locale for the given category.\n\nThis function may not be thread safe because of its reliance on C function\n`setlocale`.
setmaxstack lpeg.setmaxstack(max)\nSets the maximum size for the backtrack stack used by LPeg to track calls and\nchoices. Most well-written patterns need little backtrack levels and\ntherefore you seldom need to change this maximum; but a few useful patterns\nmay need more space. Before changing this maximum you should try to rewrite\nyour pattern to avoid the need for extra space.
setmetatable _G.setmetatable(table, metatable)\nSets the metatable for the given table. (You cannot change the metatable\nof other types from Lua, only from C.) If `metatable` is nil, removes the\nmetatable of the given table. If the original metatable has a `"__metatable"`\nfield, raises an error.\n\nThis function returns `table`.
setmetatable debug.setmetatable(value, table)\nSets the metatable for the given `value` to the given `table` (which\ncan be nil).
setmode lfs.setmode(file, mode)\nSets the writing mode for a file. The mode string can be either binary or\ntext. Returns the previous mode string for the file. This function is only\navailable in Windows, so you may want to make sure that lfs.setmode exists\nbefore using it.
setupvalue debug.setupvalue(f, up, value)\nThis function assigns the value `value` to the upvalue with index `up`\nof the function `f`. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the\ngiven index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.
setuservalue debug.setuservalue(udata, value)\nSets the given `value` as the Lua value associated to the given `udata`.\n`value` must be a table or nil; `udata` must be a full userdata.\n\nReturns `udata`.
setvbuf file:setvbuf(mode [, size])\nSets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available\nmodes:\n  "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.\n  "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the\n          buffer is full or when you explicitly `flush` the file (see\n          `io.flush`).\n  "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or\n          there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal\n          device).\n\nFor the last two cases, `size` specifies the size of the buffer, in\nbytes. The default is an appropriate size.
shebangs textadept.file_types.shebangs (table)\nMap of shebang words to their associated lexer names.\nIf the file has a shebang line, a line that starts with "#!" and is the first\nline in the file, each shebang word is matched against that line.
show_documentation textadept.editing.show_documentation()\nDisplays a call tip with documentation for the symbol under or directly\nbehind the caret.\nIf a call tip is already shown, cycles to the next one if it exists.\nDocumentation is stored in API files in the `api_files` table.\nSymbols are determined by using `buffer.word_chars`.\n@see api_files\n@see buffer.word_chars
show_lines buffer.show_lines(buffer, start_line, end_line)\nShows the range of lines between line numbers *start_line* to *end_line*.\nThis has no effect on fold levels or fold flags and the first line cannot be\nhidden.\n@param buffer A buffer.\n@param start_line The start line of the range of lines in *buffer* to show.\n@param end_line The end line of the range of lines in *buffer* to show.
sin math.sin(x)\nReturns the sine of `x` (assumed to be in radians).
sinh math.sinh(x)\nReturns the hyperbolic sine of `x`.
size ui.size (table)\nA table containing the width and height pixel values of Textadept's window.
size view.size (number)\nThe split resizer's pixel position if the view is a split one.
snapopen io.snapopen(paths, filter, exclude_FILTER, opts)\nPrompts the user to select files to be opened from *paths*, a string\ndirectory path or list of directory paths, using a filtered list dialog.\nIf *paths* is `nil`, uses the current project's root directory, which is\nobtained from `io.get_project_root()`.\nFiles shown in the dialog do not match any pattern in either string or table\n*filter* or, unless *exclude_FILTER* is `true`, in `lfs.FILTER`. A filter\ntable contains Lua patterns that match filenames to exclude, an optional\n`folders` sub-table that contains patterns matching directories to exclude,\nand an optional `extensions` sub-table that contains raw file extensions to\nexclude. Any patterns starting with '!' exclude files and directories that do\nnot match the pattern that follows. The number of files in the list is capped\nat `SNAPOPEN_MAX`. If *filter* is `nil` and *paths* is ultimately a string,\nthe filter from the `io.snapopen_filters` table is used. In that case, unless\nexplicitly specified, *exclude_FILTER* becomes `true`.\n*opts* is an optional table of additional options for\n`ui.dialogs.filteredlist()`.\n@param paths Optional string directory path or table of directory paths to\n  search. The default value is the current project's root directory, if\n  available.\n@param filter Optional filter for files and directories to exclude. The\n  default value comes from `io.snapopen_filters` if *paths* is a string.\n@param exclude_FILTER Optional flag indicating whether or not to exclude the\n  default filter `lfs.FILTER` in the search. If `false`, adds `lfs.FILTER` to\n  *filter*.\n  Normally, the default value is `false` to include the default filter.\n  However, in the instances where *filter* comes from `io.snapopen_filters`,\n  the default value is `true`.\n@param opts Optional table of additional options for\n  `ui.dialogs.filteredlist()`.\n@usage io.snapopen(buffer.filename:match('^.+/')) -- list all files in the\n  current file's directory, subject to the default filter\n@usage io.snapopen('/project', '!%.lua$') -- list all Lua files in a project\n   directory\n@usage io.snapopen('/project', {folders = {'build'}}) -- list all source\n  files in a project directory\n@see io.snapopen_filters\n@see lfs.FILTER\n@see SNAPOPEN_MAX\n@see ui.dialogs.filteredlist

snippets textadept.snippets (module)\nSnippets for Textadept.
sort table.sort(list [, comp])\nSorts list elements in a given order, *in-place*, from `list[1]` to\n`list[#list]`. If `comp` is given, then it must be a function that receives\ntwo list elements and returns true when the first element must come before\nthe second in the final order (so that `not comp(list[i+1],list[i])` will be\ntrue after the sort). If `comp` is not given, then the standard Lua operator\n`<` is used instead.\n\nThe sort algorithm is not stable; that is, elements considered equal by the\ngiven order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.
space lexer.space (pattern)\nA pattern that matches any whitespace character ('\t', '\v', '\f', '\n',\n'\r', space).
spawn _G.spawn(argv, cwd, stdout_cb, stderr_cb, exit_cb)\nSpawns an interactive child process *argv* in a separate thread, returning\na handle to that process.\nAt the moment, only the Win32 terminal version spawns processes in the same\nthread.\n@param argv A command line string containing the program's name followed by\n  arguments to pass to it. `PATH` is searched for program names.\n@param cwd Optional current working directory (cwd) for the child\n  process. The default value is `nil`, which inherits the parent's cwd.\n@param stdout_cb Optional Lua function that accepts a string parameter for a\n  block of standard output read from the child. Stdout is read asynchronously\n  in 1KB or 0.5KB blocks (depending on the platform), or however much data is\n  available at the time.\n  At the moment, only the Win32 terminal version sends all output, whether it\n  be stdout or stderr, to this callback after the process finishes.\n@param stderr_cb Optional Lua function that accepts a string parameter for a\n  block of standard error read from the child.

For a description of these fields, see the `os.date`\nfunction.\n\nThe returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In\nPOSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of\nseconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the\nmeaning is not specified, and the number returned by `time` can be used only\nas an argument to `os.date` and `os.difftime`.

tmpname os.tmpname()\nReturns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary\nfile. The file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly\nremoved when no longer needed.\n\nOn POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid\nsecurity risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in\nthe time between getting the name and creating the file.) You still have to\nopen the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it).\n\nWhen possible, you may prefer to use `io.tmpfile`, which automatically\nremoves the file when the program ends.

tonumber _G.tonumber(e [, base])\nWhen called with no `base`, `tonumber` tries to convert its argument to a\nnumber. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a\nnumber (see §3.4.2), then `tonumber` returns this number; otherwise, it\nreturns nil.\n\nWhen called with `base`, then `e` should be a string to be interpreted as an\ninteger numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36,\ninclusive. In bases above 10, the letter '`A`' (in either upper or lower\ncase) represents 10, '`B`' represents 11, and so forth, with '`Z`'\nrepresenting 35. If the string `e` is not a valid numeral in the given base,\nthe function returns nil
tostring _G.tostring(v)\nReceives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a reasonable\nformat. (For complete control of how numbers are converted, use\n`string.format`.)\n\nIf the metatable of `v` has a `"__tostring"` field, then `tostring` calls the\ncorresponding value with `v` as argument, and uses the result of the call as\nits result.

The first argument is the filename, the second argument (atime) is\nthe access time, and the third argument (mtime) is the modification time.\nBoth times are provided in seconds (which should be generated with Lua\nstandard function os.time). If the modification time is omitted, the access\ntime provided is used; if both times are omitted, the current time is used.\n\nReturns true if the operation was successful; in case of error, it returns\nnil plus an error string.
traceback debug.traceback([thread, ] [message] [, level])\nIf `message` is present but is neither a string nor nil, this function\nreturns `message` without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string\nwith a traceback of the call stack. An optional `message` string is appended\nat the beginning of the traceback. An optional `level` number tells at which\nlevel to start the traceback (default is 1, the function calling\n`traceback`).
