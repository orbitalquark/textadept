CONSTANT lexer.CONSTANT\n\n
CTRL keys.CTRL [string]\nThe string representing the Control key.\n
Carg lpeg.Carg(n)\nCreates an argument capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces\nthe value given as the nth extra argument given in the call to lpeg.match.\n
Cb lpeg.Cb(name)\nCreates a back capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces the\nvalues produced by the most recent group capture named name. Most recent means\nthe last complete outermost group capture with the given name. A Complete\ncapture means that the entire pattern corresponding to the capture has\nmatched. An Outermost capture means that the capture is not inside another\ncomplete capture.\n
Cc lpeg.Cc([value, ...])\nCreates a constant capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces\nall given values as its captured values.\n
Cf lpeg.Cf(patt, func)\nCreates a fold capture. If patt produces a list of captures C1 C2 ... Cn,\nthis capture will produce the value func(...func(func(C1, C2), C3)...,\nCn), that is, it will fold (or accumulate, or reduce) the captures from\npatt using function func. This capture assumes that patt should produce at\nleast one capture with at least one value (of any type), which becomes the\ninitial value of an accumulator. (If you need a specific initial value,\nyou may prefix a constant capture to patt.) For each subsequent capture\nLPeg calls func with this accumulator as the first argument and all values\nproduced by the capture as extra arguments; the value returned by this call\nbecomes the new value for the accumulator. The final value of the accumulator\nbecomes the captured value. As an example, the following pattern matches a\nlist of numbers separated by commas and returns their addition: -- matches\na numeral and captures its value number = lpeg.R"09"^1 / tonumber -- matches\na list of numbers, captures their values list = number * ("," * number)^0 --\nauxiliary function to add two numbers function add (acc, newvalue) return acc\n+ newvalue end -- folds the list of numbers adding them sum = lpeg.Cf(list,\nadd) -- example of use print(sum:match("10,30,43"))   --> 83\n
Cg lpeg.Cg(patt [, name])\nCreates a group capture. It groups all values returned by patt into a single\ncapture. The group may be anonymous (if no name is given) or named with the\ngiven name. An anonymous group serves to join values from several captures into\na single capture. A named group has a different behavior. In most situations,\na named group returns no values at all. Its values are only relevant for a\nfollowing back capture or when used inside a table capture.\n
Cmt lpeg.Cmt(patt, function)\nCreates a match-time capture. Unlike all other captures, this one is evaluated\nimmediately when a match occurs. It forces the immediate evaluation of all its\nnested captures and then calls function. The given function gets as arguments\nthe entire subject, the current position (after the match of patt), plus any\ncapture values produced by patt. The first value returned by function defines\nhow the match happens. If the call returns a number, the match succeeds and\nthe returned number becomes the new current position. (Assuming a subject s\nand current position i, the returned number must be in the range [i, len(s)\n+ 1].) If the call returns true, the match succeeds without consuming any\ninput. (So, to return true is equivalent to return i.) If the call returns\nfalse, nil, or no value, the match fails. Any extra values returned by the\nfunction become the values produced by the capture.\n
Cp lpeg.Cp()\nCreates a position capture. It matches the empty string and captures the\nposition in the subject where the match occurs. The captured value is a number.\n
Cs lpeg.Cs(patt)\nCreates a substitution capture, which captures the substring of the subject\nthat matches patt, with substitutions. For any capture inside patt with\na value, the substring that matched the capture is replaced by the capture\nvalue (which should be a string). The final captured value is the string\nresulting from all replacements.\n
Ct lpeg.Ct(patt)\nCreates a table capture. This capture creates a table and puts all values\nfrom all anonymous captures made by patt inside this table in successive\ninteger keys, starting at 1. Moreover, for each named capture group created\nby patt, the first value of the group is put into the table with the group\nname as its key. The captured value is only the table.\n

Each style number set with\n`buffer.annotation_style` has the offset added before looking up the style.\n

Since there may be many duplicate symbol\nnames, it is recommended to put the full symbol and arguments, if any, on the\nfirst line. (e.g. Class.function(arg1, arg2, ...)). This allows the correct\ndocumentation to be shown based on the current context. In the documentation,\nnewlines are represented with '\\n'. A '\' before '\\n' escapes the newline.\n

atan2 math.atan2(y, x)\nReturns the arc tangent of `y/x` (in radians), but uses the signs of both\nparameters to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles correctly\nthe case of `x` being zero.)\n
attributes lfs.attributes(filepath [, aname])\nReturns a table with the file attributes corresponding to filepath (or\nnil followed by an error message in case of error). If the second optional\nargument is given, then only the value of the named attribute is returned\n(this use is equivalent to lfs.attributes(filepath).aname, but the table is not\ncreated and only one attribute is retrieved from the O.S.). The attributes are\ndescribed as follows; attribute mode is a string, all the others are numbers,\nand the time related attributes use the same time reference of os.time: dev:\non Unix systems, this represents the device that the inode resides on. On\nWindows systems, represents the drive number of the disk containing the file\nino: on Unix systems, this represents the inode number. On Windows systems\nthis has no meaning mode: string representing the associated protection mode\n(the values could be file, directory, link, socket, named pipe, char device,\nblock device or other) nlink: number of hard links to the file uid: user-id\nof owner (Unix only, always 0 on Windows) gid: group-id of owner (Unix only,\nalways 0 on Windows) rdev: on Unix systems, represents the device type, for\nspecial file inodes. On Windows systems represents the same as dev access:\ntime of last access modification: time of last data modification change:\ntime of last file status change size: file size, in bytes blocks: block\nallocated for file; (Unix only) blksize: optimal file system I/O blocksize;\n(Unix only) This function uses stat internally thus if the given filepath is\na symbolic link, it is followed (if it points to another link the chain is\nfollowed recursively) and the information is about the file it refers to. To\nobtain information about the link itself, see function lfs.symlinkattributes.\n

ctags_kinds _m.textadept.adeptsense.ctags_kinds [table]\nContains a map of ctags kinds to adeptsense kinds. Recognized kinds are\n'functions', 'fields', and 'classes'. Classes are quite simply containers\nfor functions and fields so Lua modules would count as classes. Any other\nkinds will be passed to handle_ctag() for user-defined handling.\n@see handle_ctag\n
current_pos buffer.current_pos [number]\nThe position of the caret. When setting, the caret is not scrolled into view.\n
current_word _m.textadept.editing.current_word(action)\nSelects the current word under the caret and if action indicates, deletes it.\n@param action Optional action to perform with selected word. If 'delete',\nit is deleted.\n

cursor buffer.cursor [number]\nThe cursor type.\n    * `_SCINTILLA.constants.SC_CURSORNORMAL` (-1): The normal cursor is\n      displayed.\n    * `_SCINTILLA.constants.SC_CURSORWAIT` (4): The wait cursor is\n      displayed when the mouse is over the view.\n\n
cut buffer.cut(buffer)\nCut the selection to the clipboard.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n
date os.date([format [, time]])\nReturns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to\nthe given string `format`. If the `time` argument is present, this is the\ntime to be formatted (see the `os.time` function for a description of this\nvalue). Otherwise, `date` formats the current time. If `format` starts with\n'`!`', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal Time. After\nthis optional character, if `format` is the string "`*t`", then `date`\nreturns a table with the following fields: `year` (four digits), `month`\n(1--12), `day` (1--31), `hour` (0--23), `min` (0--59), `sec` (0--61), `wday`\n(weekday, Sunday is 1), `yday` (day of the year), and `isdst` (daylight\nsaving flag, a boolean). If `format` is not "`*t`", then `date` returns the\ndate as a string, formatted according to the same rules as the C function\n`strftime`. When called without arguments, `date` returns a reasonable date\nand time representation that depends on the host system and on the current\nlocale (that is, `os.date()` is equivalent to `os.date("%c")`).\n

difftime os.difftime(t2, t1)\nReturns the number of seconds from time `t1` to time `t2`. In POSIX, Windows,\nand some other systems, this value is exactly `t2`*-*`t1`.\n
digit lexer.digit\nMatches any digit (`0-9`).\n
dir lfs.dir(path)\nLua iterator over the entries of a given directory. Each time the iterator\nis called with dir_obj it returns a directory entry's name as a string,\nor nil if there are no more entries.

error _G.error(message [, level])\nTerminates the last protected function called and returns `message` as the\nerror message. Function `error` never returns. Usually, `error` adds some\ninformation about the error position at the beginning of the message. The\n`level` argument specifies how to get the error position. With level 1 (the\ndefault), the error position is where the `error` function was called. Level\n2 points the error to where the function that called `error` was called; and\nso on. Passing a level 0 avoids the addition of error position information\nto the message.\n

execute os.execute([command])\nThis function is equivalent to the C function `system`. It passes `command`\nto be executed by an operating system shell. It returns a status code,\nwhich is system-dependent. If `command` is absent, then it returns nonzero\nif a shell is available and zero otherwise.\n
exit os.exit([code])\nCalls the C function `exit`, with an optional `code`, to terminate the host\nprogram. The default value for `code` is the success code.\n
exp math.exp(x)\nReturns the value *e^x*.\n

filter_through _m.textadept.filter_through.filter_through()\nPrompts for a Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows shell command to filter text\nthrough. The standard input (stdin) for shell commands is determined as\nfollows: (1) If text is selected and spans multiple lines, all text on the\nlines containing the selection is used. However, if the end of the selection\nis at the beginning of a line, only the EOL (end of line) characters from the\nprevious line are included as input. The rest of the line is excluded. (2) If\ntext is selected and spans a single line, only the selected text is used. (3)\nIf no text is selected, the entire buffer is used. The input text is replaced\nwith the standard output (stdout) of the command.\n

find gui.find [module]\nTextadept's integrated find/replace dialog.\n
find string.find(s, pattern [, init [, plain]])\nLooks for the first match of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds a\nmatch, then `find` returns the indices of `s` where this occurrence starts\nand ends; otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numerical argument\n`init` specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can\nbe negative. A value of true as a fourth, optional argument `plain` turns off\nthe pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring"\noperation, with no characters in `pattern` being considered "magic". Note that\nif `plain` is given, then `init` must be given as well. If the pattern has\ncaptures, then in a successful match the captured values are also returned,\nafter the two indices.\n
find_column buffer.find_column(buffer, line, column)\nFind the position of a column on a line taking into account tabs and multi-byte\ncharacters. If beyond end of line, return line end position.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n@param line The line number.\n@param column The column number.\n

format string.format(formatstring, ···)\nReturns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following\nthe description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The\nformat string follows the same rules as the `printf` family of standard C\nfunctions. The only differences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `l`,\n`L`, `n`, `p`, and `h` are not supported and that there is an extra option,\n`q`. The `q` option formats a string in a form suitable to be safely read back\nby the Lua interpreter: the string is written between double quotes, and all\ndouble quotes, newlines, embedded zeros, and backslashes in the string are\ncorrectly escaped when written. For instance, the call string.format('%q',\n'a string with "quotes" and \\n new line') will produce the string: "a string\nwith \"quotes\" and \ new line" The options `c`, `d`, `E`, `e`, `f`, `g`,\n`G`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x` all expect a number as argument, whereas\n`q` and `s` expect a string. This function does not accept string values\ncontaining embedded zeros, except as arguments to the `q` option.\n
frexp math.frexp(x)\nReturns `m` and `e` such that *x = m2^e*, `e` is an integer and the absolute\nvalue of `m` is in the range *[0.5, 1)* (or zero when `x` is zero).\n

getfenv _G.getfenv([f])\nReturns the current environment in use by the function. `f` can be a Lua\nfunction or a number that specifies the function at that stack level:\nLevel 1 is the function calling `getfenv`. If the given function is not a\nLua function, or if `f` is 0, `getfenv` returns the global environment. The\ndefault for `f` is 1.\n
getfenv debug.getfenv(o)\nReturns the environment of object `o`.\n
gethook debug.gethook([thread])\nReturns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the current\nhook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count (as set by\nthe `debug.sethook` function).\n
getinfo debug.getinfo([thread, ] function [, what])\nReturns a table with information about a function. You can give the function\ndirectly, or you can give a number as the value of `function`, which means\nthe function running at level `function` of the call stack of the given\nthread: level 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself); level 1 is the\nfunction that called `getinfo`; and so on. If `function` is a number larger\nthan the number of active functions, then `getinfo` returns nil. The returned\ntable can contain all the fields returned by `lua_getinfo`, with the string\n`what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for `what` is to get\nall information available, except the table of valid lines. If present,\nthe option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with the function itself. If\npresent, the option '`L`' adds a field named `activelines` with the table\nof valid lines. For instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name`\nreturns a table with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name\ncan be found, and the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with\nall available information about the `print` function.\n
getlocal debug.getlocal([thread, ] level, local)\nThis function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index\n`local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. (The first parameter\nor local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last active local\nvariable.) The function returns nil if there is no local variable with the\ngiven index, and raises an error when called with a `level` out of range. (You\ncan call `debug.getinfo` to check whether the level is valid.) Variable\nnames starting with '`(`' (open parentheses) represent internal variables\n(loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).\n
getmetatable _G.getmetatable(object)\nIf `object` does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the object's\nmetatable has a `"__metatable"` field, returns the associated value. Otherwise,\nreturns the metatable of the given object.\n
getmetatable debug.getmetatable(object)\nReturns the metatable of the given `object` or nil if it does not have\na metatable.\n
getregistry debug.getregistry()\nReturns the registry table (see §3.5).\n
getupvalue debug.getupvalue(func, up)\nThis function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index `up`\nof the function `func`. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with\nthe given index.\n
gmatch string.gmatch(s, pattern)\nReturns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the\nnext captures from `pattern` over string `s`. If `pattern` specifies no\ncaptures, then the whole match is produced in each call. As an example,\nthe following loop s = "hello world from Lua" for w in string.gmatch(s,\n"%a+") do print(w) end will iterate over all the words from string `s`,\nprinting one per line. The next example collects all pairs `key=value`\nfrom the given string into a table: t = {} s = "from=world, to=Lua" for k,\nv in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do t[k] = v end For this function, a\n'`^`' at the start of a pattern does not work as an anchor, as this would\nprevent the iteration.\n

gsub string.gsub(s, pattern, repl [, n])\nReturns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given) occurrences\nof the `pattern` have been replaced by a replacement string specified by\n`repl`, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub` also returns,\nas its second value, the total number of matches that occurred. If `repl`\nis a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character `%`\nworks as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `%n`, with\n*n* between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the *n*-th captured substring\n(see below). The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The sequence `%%`\nstands for a single `%`. If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for\nevery match, using the first capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no\ncaptures, then the whole match is used as the key. If `repl` is a function,\nthen this function is called every time a match occurs, with all captured\nsubstrings passed as arguments, in order; if the pattern specifies no\ncaptures, then the whole match is passed as a sole argument. If the value\nreturned by the table query or by the function call is a string or a number,\nthen it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is false or nil,\nthen there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the\nstring). Here are some examples: x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)",\n"%1 %1") --> x="hello hello world world" x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+",\n"%0 %0", 1) --> x="hello hello world" x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua",\n"(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1") --> x="world hello Lua from" x = string.gsub("home =\n$HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv) --> x="home = /home/roberto, user =\nroberto" x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s) return\nloadstring(s)() end) --> x="4+5 = 9" local t = {name="lua", version="5.1"}\nx = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t) --> x="lua-5.1.tar.gz"\n

line_visible buffer.line_visible [bool]\nIs a line visible? (Read-only)\n
lines file:lines()\nReturns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns a new\nline from the file. Therefore, the construction for line in file:lines()\ndo *body* end will iterate over all lines of the file. (Unlike `io.lines`,\nthis function does not close the file when the loop ends.)\n
lines io.lines([filename])\nOpens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that,\neach time it is called, returns a new line from the file. Therefore, the\nconstruction for line in io.lines(filename) do *body* end will iterate over\nall lines of the file. When the iterator function detects the end of file,\nit returns nil (to finish the loop) and automatically closes the file. The\ncall `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to `io.input():lines()`;\nthat is, it iterates over the lines of the default input file. In this case\nit does not close the file when the loop ends.\n
lines_join buffer.lines_join(buffer)\nJoin the lines in the target. Where this would lead to no space between words,\nan extra space is inserted.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n
lines_on_screen buffer.lines_on_screen [number]\nThe number of lines completely visible. (Read-only)\n
lines_split buffer.lines_split(buffer, pixel_width)\nSplit the lines in the target into lines that are less wide than pixel_width\nwhere possible.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n@param pixel_width The pixel width. When 0, the width of the view is used.\n
load _G.load(func [, chunkname])\nLoads a chunk using function `func` to get its pieces. Each call to `func`\nmust return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of\nan empty string, nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk. If there\nare no errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise, returns\nnil plus the error message. The environment of the returned function is the\nglobal environment. `chunkname` is used as the chunk name for error messages\nand debug information. When absent, it defaults to "`=(load)`".\n
load _m.textadept.session.load(filename)\nLoads a Textadept session file. Textadept restores split views, opened buffers,\ncursor information, and project manager details.\n@param filename The absolute path to the session file to load. Defaults to\nDEFAULT_SESSION if not specified.\n@usage _m.textadept.session.load(filename)\n@return true if the session file was opened and read; false otherwise.\n

load_ctags _m.textadept.adeptsense.load_ctags(sense, tag_file, nolocations)\nLoads the given ctags file for autocompletion. It is recommended to pass '-n'\nto ctags in order to use line numbers instead of text patterns to locate\ntags. This will greatly reduce memory usage for a large number of symbols\nif nolocations is not true.\n@param sense The adeptsense returned by adeptsense.new().\n@param tag_file The path of the ctags file to load.\n@param nolocations If true, does not store the locations of the tags for\nuse by goto_ctag(). Defaults to false.\n
load_project _m.rails.load_project(utf8_dir)\nSets keys.al.o to snapopen a Rails project. If not directory is provided,\nthe user is prompted for one.\n@param utf8_dir The UTF-8 Rails project directory.\n
loaded package.loaded\nA table used by `require` to control which modules are already loaded. When\nyou require a module `modname` and `package.loaded[modname]` is not false,\n`require` simply returns the value stored there.\n
loaders package.loaders\nA table used by `require` to control how to load modules. Each entry in\nthis table is a *searcher function*. When looking for a module, `require`\ncalls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module name\n(the argument given to `require`) as its sole parameter. The function can\nreturn another function (the module *loader*) or a string explaining why it\ndid not find that module (or nil if it has nothing to say). Lua initializes\nthis table with four functions. The first searcher simply looks for a loader\nin the `package.preload` table. The second searcher looks for a loader as a\nLua library, using the path stored at `package.path`. A path is a sequence\nof *templates* separated by semicolons. For each template, the searcher will\nchange each interrogation mark in the template by `filename`, which is the\nmodule name with each dot replaced by a "directory separator" (such as "`/`"\nin Unix); then it will try to open the resulting file name. So, for instance,\nif the Lua path is the string\n  "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"\nthe search for a Lua file for module `foo` will try to open the files\n`./foo.lua`, `./foo.lc`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.lua`, in that order. The\nthird searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by\nthe variable `package.cpath`. For instance, if the C path is the string\n  "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"\nthe searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`,\n`./foo.dll`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order. Once it finds\na C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the\napplication with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the\nlibrary to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string\n"`luaopen_`" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is\nreplaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its\nprefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the\nmodule name is `a.v1-b.c`, the function name will be `luaopen_b_c`. The fourth\nsearcher tries an *all-in-one loader*. It searches the C path for a library\nfor the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring `a.b.c`,\nit will search for a C library for `a`. If found, it looks into it for an open\nfunction for the submodule; in our example, that would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With\nthis facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library,\nwith each submodule keeping its original open function.\n
loadfile _G.loadfile([filename])\nSimilar to `load`, but gets the chunk from file `filename` or from the\nstandard input, if no file name is given.\n
loadlib package.loadlib(libname, funcname)\nDynamically links the host program with the C library `libname`. Inside this\nlibrary, looks for a function `funcname` and returns this function as a C\nfunction. (So, `funcname` must follow the protocol (see `lua_CFunction`)). This\nis a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module\nsystem. Unlike `require`, it does not perform any path searching and does\nnot automatically adds extensions. `libname` must be the complete file name\nof the C library, including if necessary a path and extension. `funcname`\nmust be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the C\ncompiler and linker used). This function is not supported by ANSI C. As such,\nit is only available on some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,\nBSD, plus other Unix systems that support the `dlfcn` standard).\n
loadstring _G.loadstring(string [, chunkname])\nSimilar to `load`, but gets the chunk from the given string. To load and\nrun a given string, use the idiom assert(loadstring(s))() When absent,\n`chunkname` defaults to the given string.\n
locale _G.locale [module]\nContains all messages used by Textadept for localization.\n
locale lpeg.locale([table])\nReturns a table with patterns for matching some character classes according\nto the current locale. The table has fields named alnum, alpha, cntrl, digit,\ngraph, lower, print, punct, space, upper, and xdigit, each one containing a\ncorrespondent pattern. Each pattern matches any single character that belongs\nto its class. If called with an argument table, then it creates those fields\ninside the given table and returns that table.\n
localize locale.localize(id)\nLocalizes the given string.\n@param id String to localize.\n
locations _m.textadept.adeptsense.locations [table]\nContains the locations of known symbols. This table is populated by\nload_ctags().\n
lock lfs.lock(filehandle, mode[, start[, length]])\nLocks a file or a part of it. This function works on open files; the file\nhandle should be specified as the first argument. The string mode could be\neither r (for a read/shared lock) or w (for a write/exclusive lock). The\noptional arguments start and length can be used to specify a starting point\nand its length; both should be numbers. Returns true if the operation was\nsuccessful; in case of error, it returns nil plus an error string.\n
lock_dir lfs.lock_dir(path, [seconds_stale])\nCreates a lockfile (called lockfile.lfs) in path if it does not exist and\nreturns the lock. If the lock already exists checks it it's stale, using\nthe second parameter (default for the second parameter is INT_MAX, which\nin practice means the lock will never be stale. To free the the lock call\nlock:free(). In case of any errors it returns nil and the error message. In\nparticular, if the lock exists and is not stale it returns the "File exists"\nmessage.\n
log math.log(x)\nReturns the natural logarithm of `x`.\n
log10 math.log10(x)\nReturns the base-10 logarithm of `x`.\n
lower lexer.lower\nMatches any lowercase character (`a-z`).\n
lower string.lower(s)\nReceives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase\nletters changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The\ndefinition of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.\n

match lpeg.match(pattern, subject [, init])\nThe matching function. It attempts to match the given pattern against the\nsubject string. If the match succeeds, returns the index in the subject of\nthe first character after the match, or the captured values (if the pattern\ncaptured any value). An optional numeric argument init makes the match starts\nat that position in the subject string. As usual in Lua libraries, a negative\nvalue counts from the end. Unlike typical pattern-matching functions, match\nworks only in anchored mode; that is, it tries to match the pattern with a\nprefix of the given subject string (at position init), not with an arbitrary\nsubstring of the subject. So, if we want to find a pattern anywhere in a\nstring, we must either write a loop in Lua or write a pattern that matches\nanywhere. This second approach is easy and quite efficient; see examples.\n
match string.match(s, pattern [, init])\nLooks for the first *match* of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds one,\nthen `match` returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise it returns\nnil. If `pattern` specifies no captures, then the whole match is returned. A\nthird, optional numerical argument `init` specifies where to start the search;\nits default value is 1 and can be negative.\n
match_brace _m.textadept.editing.match_brace(select)\nGoes to a matching brace position, selecting the text inside if specified.\n@param select If true, selects the text between matching braces.\n

modify buffer.modify [bool]\nWhether the document is different from when it was last saved.\n
module _G.module(name [, ···])\nCreates a module. If there is a table in `package.loaded[name]`, this table is\nthe module. Otherwise, if there is a global table `t` with the given name, this\ntable is the module. Otherwise creates a new table `t` and sets it as the value\nof the global `name` and the value of `package.loaded[name]`. This function\nalso initializes `t._NAME` with the given name, `t._M` with the module (`t`\nitself), and `t._PACKAGE` with the package name (the full module name minus\nlast component; see below). Finally, `module` sets `t` as the new environment\nof the current function and the new value of `package.loaded[name]`, so\nthat `require` returns `t`. If `name` is a compound name (that is, one\nwith components separated by dots), `module` creates (or reuses, if they\nalready exist) tables for each component. For instance, if `name` is `a.b.c`,\nthen `module` stores the module table in field `c` of field `b` of global\n`a`. This function can receive optional *options* after the module name,\nwhere each option is a function to be applied over the module.\n
mouse_down_captures buffer.mouse_down_captures [bool]\nWhether the mouse is captured when its button is pressed.\n
mouse_dwell_time buffer.mouse_dwell_time [number]\nThe time the mouse must sit still to generate a mouse dwell event. If set\nto `_SCINTILLA.constants.SC_TIME_FOREVER`, the default, no dwell events\nare generated.\n

move_selected_lines_down buffer.move_selected_lines_down(buffer)\nMove the selected lines down one line, shifting the line below before the\nselection. The selection will be automatically extended to the beginning\nof the selection's first line and the end of the seletion's last line. If\nnothing was selected, the line the cursor is currently at will be selected.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n
move_selected_lines_up buffer.move_selected_lines_up(buffer)\nMove the selected lines up one line, shifting the line above after the\nselection. The selection will be automatically extended to the beginning\nof the selection's first line and the end of the seletion's last line.

nested_pair lexer.nested_pair(start_chars, end_chars, end_optional)\nSimilar to `delimited_range()`, but allows for multi-character\ndelimitters. This is useful for lexers with tokens such as nested block\ncomments. With single-character delimiters, this function is identical to\n`delimited_range(start_chars..end_chars, nil, end_optional, true)`.\n@param start_chars The string starting a nested sequence.\n@param end_chars The string ending a nested sequence.\n@param end_optional Optional flag indicating whether or not an ending delimiter\nis optional or not. If true, the range begun by the start delimiter matches\nuntil an end delimiter or the end of the input is reached.\n@usage local nested_comment = l.nested_pair('/*', '*/', true)\n
new _m.textadept.adeptsense.new(lang)\nCreates a new adeptsense for the given lexer language. Only one sense can\nexist per language.\n@param lang The lexer language to create an adeptsense for.\n@usage local lua_sense = _m.textadept.adeptsense.new('lua')\n@return adeptsense.\n

new_line buffer.new_line(buffer)\nInsert a new line, may use a CRLF, CR or LF depending on EOL mode.\n@param buffer The focused buffer.\n
newline lexer.newline\nMatches any newline characters.\n
next _G.next(table [, index])\nAllows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is\na table and its second argument is an index in this table. `next` returns\nthe next index of the table and its associated value. When called with nil\nas its second argument, `next` returns an initial index and its associated\nvalue. When called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table,\n`next` returns nil. If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted\nas nil. In particular, you can use `next(t)` to check whether a table is\nempty. The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, *even\nfor numeric indices*. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical\nfor or the `ipairs` function.) The behavior of `next` is *undefined* if,\nduring the traversal, you assign any value to a non-existent field in the\ntable. You may however modify existing fields. In particular, you may clear\nexisting fields.\n
next_indic_number _SCINTILLA.next_indic_number()\nReturns a unique indicator number. Use this function for custom indicators\nin order to prevent clashes with identifiers of other custom indicators.\n@usage local indic_num = _SCINTILLA.next_indic_number()\n

require _G.require(modname)\nLoads the given module. The function starts by looking into the\n`package.loaded` table to determine whether `modname` is already\nloaded. If it is, then `require` returns the value stored at\n`package.loaded[modname]`. Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader* for the\nmodule. To find a loader, `require` is guided by the `package.loaders`\narray. By changing this array, we can change how `require` looks for a\nmodule. The following explanation is based on the default configuration for\n`package.loaders`. First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it\nhas a value, this value (which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise\n`require` searches for a Lua loader using the path stored in `package.path`. If\nthat also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in\n`package.cpath`. If that also fails, it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see\n`package.loaders`). Once a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with\na single argument, `modname`. If the loader returns any value, `require`\nassigns the returned value to `package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader returns\nno value and has not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then\n`require` assigns true to this entry. In any case, `require` returns the\nfinal value of `package.loaded[modname]`. If there is any error loading or\nrunning the module, or if it cannot find any loader for the module, then\n`require` signals an error.\n
reset _G.reset()\nResets the Lua state by reloading all init scripts. Language-specific modules\nfor opened files are NOT reloaded. Re-opening the files that use them will\nreload those modules. This function is useful for modifying init scripts\n(such as keys.lua) on the fly without having to restart Textadept. A global\nRESETTING variable is set to true when re-initing the Lua State. Any scripts\nthat need to differentiate between startup and reset can utilize this variable.\n
resume coroutine.resume(co [, val1, ···])\nStarts or continues the execution of coroutine `co`. The first time you resume\na coroutine, it starts running its body. The values `val1`, ··· are passed\nas the arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, `resume`\nrestarts it; the values `val1`, ··· are passed as the results from the\nyield. If the coroutine runs without any errors, `resume` returns true plus\nany values passed to `yield` (if the coroutine yields) or any values returned\nby the body function (if the coroutine terminates). If there is any error,\n`resume` returns false plus the error message.\n
reverse string.reverse(s)\nReturns a string that is the string `s` reversed.\n

setfenv _G.setfenv(f, table)\nSets the environment to be used by the given function. `f` can be a Lua\nfunction or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level 1\nis the function calling `setfenv`. `setfenv` returns the given function. As a\nspecial case, when `f` is 0 `setfenv` changes the environment of the running\nthread. In this case, `setfenv` returns no values.\n

With a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every\n`count` instructions. When called without arguments, `debug.sethook` turns\noff the hook. When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string\ndescribing the event that has triggered its call: `"call"`, `"return"`\n(or `"tail return"`, when simulating a return from a tail call), `"line"`,\nand `"count"`. For line events, the hook also gets the new line number as\nits second parameter. Inside a hook, you can call `getinfo` with level 2 to\nget more information about the running function (level 0 is the `getinfo`\nfunction, and level 1 is the hook function), unless the event is `"tail\nreturn"`. In this case, Lua is only simulating the return, and a call to\n`getinfo` will return invalid data.\n
setlocal debug.setlocal([thread, ] level, local, value)\nThis function assigns the value `value` to the local variable with index\n`local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. The function returns nil\nif there is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when\ncalled with a `level` out of range. (You can call `getinfo` to check whether\nthe level is valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of the local variable.\n
setlocale os.setlocale(locale [, category])\nSets the current locale of the program. `locale` is a string specifying a\nlocale; `category` is an optional string describing which category to change:\n`"all"`, `"collate"`, `"ctype"`, `"monetary"`, `"numeric"`, or `"time"`; the\ndefault category is `"all"`. The function returns the name of the new locale,\nor nil if the request cannot be honored. If `locale` is the empty string,\nthe current locale is set to an implementation-defined native locale. If\n`locale` is the string "`C`", the current locale is set to the standard\nC locale. When called with nil as the first argument, this function only\nreturns the name of the current locale for the given category.\n
setmaxstack lpeg.setmaxstack(max)\nSets the maximum size for the backtrack stack used by LPeg to track calls\nand choices. Most well-written patterns need little backtrack levels and\ntherefore you seldom need to change this maximum; but a few useful patterns\nmay need more space. Before changing this maximum you should try to rewrite\nyour pattern to avoid the need for extra space.\n
setmetatable _G.setmetatable(table, metatable)\nSets the metatable for the given table. (You cannot change the metatable\nof other types from Lua, only from C.) If `metatable` is nil, removes the\nmetatable of the given table. If the original metatable has a `"__metatable"`\nfield, raises an error. This function returns `table`.\n
setmetatable debug.setmetatable(object, table)\nSets the metatable for the given `object` to the given `table` (which can\nbe nil).\n
setmode lfs.setmode(file, mode)\nSets the writing mode for a file. The mode string can be either binary or\ntext. Returns the previous mode string for the file. This function is only\navailable in Windows, so you may want to make sure that lfs.setmode exists\nbefore using it.\n
setupvalue debug.setupvalue(func, up, value)\nThis function assigns the value `value` to the upvalue with index `up` of\nthe function `func`. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with\nthe given index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.\n
setvbuf file:setvbuf(mode [, size])\nSets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available\nmodes: "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears\nimmediately. "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only\nwhen the buffer is full (or when you explicitly `flush` the file (see\n`io.flush`)). "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is\noutput or there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal\ndevice). For the last two cases, `size` specifies the size of the buffer,\nin bytes. The default is an appropriate size.\n
shebangs _m.textadept.mime_types.shebangs [table]\nShebang words and their associated lexers.\n
show_apidoc _m.textadept.adeptsense.show_apidoc(sense)\nShows a calltip with API documentation for the symbol behind the caret.\n@param sense The adeptsense returned by adeptsense.new().\n@return true on success or false.\n@see get_symbol\n@see get_apidoc\n

sort table.sort(table [, comp])\nSorts table elements in a given order, *in-place*, from `table[1]` to\n`table[n]`, where `n` is the length of the table. If `comp` is given, then it\nmust be a function that receives two table elements, and returns true when\nthe first is less than the second (so that `not comp(a[i+1],a[i])` will be\ntrue after the sort). If `comp` is not given, then the standard Lua operator\n``io.lines`, this function does not close the file when the loop ends.)\n
space lexer.space\nMatches any whitespace character (`\t`, `\v`, `\f`, `\\n`, `\r`, space).\n

time os.time([table])\nReturns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing\nthe date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields\n`year`, `month`, and `day`, and may have fields `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and\n`isdst` (for a description of these fields, see the `os.date` function). The\nreturned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In POSIX,\nWindows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of seconds\nsince some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the meaning\nis not specified, and the number returned by `time` can be used only as an\nargument to `date` and `difftime`.\n
timeout _G.timeout(interval, f, ...)\nCalls a given function after an interval of time. To repeatedly call the\nfunction, return true inside the function. A nil or false return value\nstops repetition.\n@param interval The interval in seconds to call the function after.\n@param f The function to call.\n@param ... Additional arguments to pass to f.\n

tmpfile io.tmpfile()\nReturns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update mode\nand it is automatically removed when the program ends.\n
tmpname os.tmpname()\nReturns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The\nfile must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when\nno longer needed. On some systems (POSIX), this function also creates a file\nwith that name, to avoid security risks. (Someone else might create the file\nwith wrong permissions in the time between getting the name and creating\nthe file.) You still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even\nif you do not use it). When possible, you may prefer to use `io.tmpfile`,\nwhich automatically removes the file when the program ends.\n
toggle _m.textadept.bookmarks.toggle()\nToggles a bookmark on the current line.\n
toggle_block _m.ruby.toggle_block()\nToggles between { ... } and do ... end Ruby blocks. If the caret is inside\na { ... } single-line block, that block is converted to a multiple-line do\n.. end block. If the caret is on a line that contains single-line do ... end\nblock, that block is converted to a single-line { ... } block. If the caret\nis inside a multiple-line do ... end block, that block is converted to a\nsingle-line { ... } block with all newlines replaced by a space. Indentation\nis important. The 'do' and 'end' keywords must be on lines with the same\nlevel of indentation to toggle correctly\n

If the argument is already a number\nor a string convertible to a number, then `tonumber` returns this number;\notherwise, it returns nil. An optional argument specifies the base to interpret\nthe numeral. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases\nabove 10, the letter '`A`' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10,\n'`B`' represents 11, and so forth, with '`Z`' representing 35. In base 10\n(the default), the number can have a decimal part, as well as an optional\nexponent part (see §2.1). In other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.\n
tostring _G.tostring(e)\nReceives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a\nreasonable format. For complete control of how numbers are converted, use\n`string.format`.

The first argument is the filename, the second argument (atime)\nis the access time, and the third argument (mtime) is the modification\ntime. Both times are provided in seconds (which should be generated with\nLua standard function os.time). If the modification time is omitted, the\naccess time provided is used; if both times are omitted, the current time\nis used. Returns true if the operation was successful; in case of error,\nit returns nil plus an error string.\n
