events _G.events (module)\nTextadept's core event structure and handlers.\n\nTextadept emits events when you do things like create a new buffer, press a key, click on\na menu, etc. You can even emit events yourself using Lua. Each event has a set of event\nhandlers, which are simply Lua functions called in the order they were connected to an\nevent. For example, if you created a module that needs to do something each time Textadept\ncreates a new buffer, connect a Lua function to the `events.BUFFER_NEW` event:\n\n    events.connect(events.BUFFER_NEW, function()\n      -- Do something here.\n    end)\n\nEvents themselves are nothing special. You do not have to declare one before using it. Events\nare simply strings containing arbitrary event names. When either you or Textadept emits an\nevent, Textadept runs all event handlers connected to the event, passing any given arguments\nto the event's handler functions. If an event handler explicitly returns a value that is not\n`nil`, Textadept will not call subsequent handlers. This is useful if you want to stop the\npropagation of an event like a keypress if your event handler handled it, or if you want to\nuse the event framework to pass values.\n
events _SCINTILLA.events (table)\nMap of Scintilla event IDs to tables of event names and event parameters.
expr_types _M.lua.expr_types (table)\nMap of expression patterns to their types.\nUsed for type-hinting when showing autocompletions for variables. Expressions are expected\nto match after the '=' sign of a statement.

filename buffer.filename (string)\nThe absolute file path associated with the buffer.
filter_through textadept.editing.filter_through(command)\nPasses the selected text or all buffer text to string shell command *command* as standard input\n(stdin) and replaces the input text with the command's standard output (stdout). *command*\nmay contain shell pipes ('|').\nStandard input is as follows:\n\n1. If no text is selected, the entire buffer is used.\n2. If text is selected and spans a single line, is a multiple selection, or is a rectangular\n  selection, only the selected text is used.\n3. If text is selected and spans multiple lines, all text on the lines that have text selected\n  is passed as stdin. However, if the end of the selection is at the beginning of a line,\n  only the line ending delimiters from the previous line are included. The rest of the line\n  is excluded.\n\nNote: Be careful when using commands that emit stdout while reading stdin (as opposed\nto emitting stdout only after stdin is closed).  Input that generates more output\nthan an OS-specific pipe can hold may hang Textadept. On Linux, this may be 64K. See\n`spawn_proc:write()`.\n@param command The Linux, macOS, or Windows shell command to filter text through. May\n  contain pipes.

A filter consists\nof Lua patterns that match file and directory paths to include or exclude. Patterns are\ninclusive by default. Exclusive patterns begin with a '!'. If no inclusive patterns are given,\nany filename is initially considered. As a convenience, file extensions can be specified\nliterally instead of as a Lua pattern (e.g. '.lua' vs. '%.lua$'), and '/' also matches the\nWindows directory separator ('[/\\]' is not needed). If *filter* is `nil`, the filter from\nthe `ui.find.find_in_files_filters` table for *dir* is used. If that filter does not exist,\n`lfs.default_filter` is used.\n@param dir Optional directory path to search. If `nil`, the user is prompted for one.\n@param filter Optional filter for files and directories to exclude.

A filter\nconsists of Lua patterns that match file and directory paths to include or exclude. Patterns\nare inclusive by default. Exclusive patterns begin with a '!'. If no inclusive patterns are\ngiven, any path is initially considered. As a convenience, file extensions can be specified\nliterally instead of as a Lua pattern (e.g. '.lua' vs. '%.lua$'), and '/' also matches the\nWindows directory separator ('[/\\]' is not needed).\nThe number of files in the list is capped at `quick_open_max`.\nIf *filter* is `nil` and *paths* is ultimately a string, the filter from the\n`io.quick_open_filters` table is used. If that filter does not exist, `lfs.default_filter`\nis used.\n@param paths Optional string directory path or table of directory paths to search. The\n  default value is the current project's root directory, if available.\n@param filter Optional filter for files and directories to include and/or exclude.

view _G.view (module)\nA Textadept view object.\nConstants are documented in the fields they apply to.\nWhile you can work with individual view instances, it is often useful to work with just the\nglobal one.\nMany of these functions and fields are derived from view-specific functionality of the\nScintilla editing component, and additional information can be found on the [Scintilla\nwebsite](https://scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html). Note that with regard to Scintilla-specific\nfunctionality, this API is a _suggestion_, not a hard requirement. All of that functionality\nalso exists in `buffer`, even if undocumented.\nAny view fields set on startup (e.g. in *~/.textadept/init.lua*) will be the default,\ninitial values for all views.
view _G.view (table)\nThe current view.

virtual_space_options buffer.virtual_space_options (number)\nThe virtual space mode.\n\n* `buffer.VS_NONE`\n  Disable virtual space.\n* `buffer.VS_RECTANGULARSELECTION`\n  Enable virtual space only for rectangular selections.\n* `buffer.VS_USERACCESSIBLE`\n  Enable virtual space.\n* `buffer.VS_NOWRAPLINESTART`\n  Prevent the caret from wrapping to the previous line via `buffer:char_left()` and\n  `buffer:char_left_extend()`. This option is not restricted to virtual space and should\n  be added to any of the above options.\n\nWhen virtual space is enabled, the caret may move into the space past end of line characters.\nThe default value is `buffer.VS_NONE`.
visible_from_doc_line view.visible_from_doc_line(view, line)\nReturns the displayed line number of actual line number *line*, taking wrapped, annotated,\nand hidden lines into account, or `-1` if *line* is outside the range of lines in the buffer.\nLines can occupy more than one display line if they wrap.\n@param view A view.\n@param line The line number in *view* to use.\n@return number

A filter consists of Lua patterns that match file and directory paths\nto include or exclude. Exclusive patterns begin with a '!'. If no inclusive patterns are\ngiven, any path is initially considered. As a convenience, file extensions can be specified\nliterally instead of as a Lua pattern (e.g. '.lua' vs. '%.lua$'), and '/' also matches the\nWindows directory separator ('[/\\]' is not needed).\n@param dir The directory path to iterate over.\n@param filter Optional filter for files and directories to include and exclude. The default\n  value is `lfs.default_filter`.\n@param n Optional maximum number of directory levels to descend into. The default value is\n  `nil`, which indicates no limit.\n@param include_dirs Optional flag indicating whether or not to yield directory names too.\n  Directory names are passed with a trailing '/' or '\', depending on the current platform.\n  The default value is `false`.\n@see filter
whitespace_chars buffer.whitespace_chars (string)\nThe string set of characters recognized as whitespace characters.\nSet this only after setting `buffer.word_chars`.\nThe default value is a string that contains all non-newline characters less than ASCII\nvalue 33.

Otherwise, the first character in the search direction sets the\n  type of the search as word or non-word and the search stops at the first non-matching\n  character. Searches are also terminated by the start or end of the buffer.

word_match lexer.word_match(lexer, word_list, case_insensitive)\nEither returns a pattern for lexer *lexer* (if given) that matches one word in the word list\nidentified by string *word_list*, ignoring case if *case_sensitive* is `true`, or, if *lexer*\nis not given, creates and returns a pattern that matches any single word in list or string\n*word_list*, ignoring case if *case_insensitive* is `true`.\nThis is a convenience function for simplifying a set of ordered choice word patterns and\npotentially allowing downstream users to configure word lists.\nIf there is ultimately no word list set via `set_word_list()`, no error will be raised,\nbut the returned pattern will not match anything.\n@param lexer Optional lexer to match a word in a wordlist for. This parameter may be omitted\n  for lexer-agnostic matching.\n@param word_list Either a string name of the word list to match from if *lexer* is given,\n  or, if *lexer* is omitted, a list of words or a string list of words separated by spaces.\n@param case_insensitive Optional boolean flag indicating whether or not the word match is\n  case-insensitive. The default value is `false`.\n@usage lex:add_rule('keyword', lex:tag(lexer.KEYWORD, lex:word_match(lexer.KEYWORD)))\n@usage local keyword = lex:tag(lexer.KEYWORD, lexer.word_match{'foo', 'bar', 'baz'})\n@usage local keyword = lex:tag(lexer.KEYWORD, lexer.word_match({'foo-bar', 'foo-baz',\n  'bar-foo', 'bar-baz', 'baz-foo', 'baz-bar'}, true))\n@usage local keyword = lex:tag(lexer.KEYWORD, lexer.word_match('foo bar baz'))\n@return pattern\n@see set_word_list
