events _G.events (module)\nTextadept's core event structure and handlers.\n\nTextadept emits events when you do things like create a new buffer, press a\nkey, click on a menu, etc. You can even emit events yourself using Lua. Each\nevent has a set of event handlers, which are simply Lua functions called in\nthe order they were connected to an event. For example, if you created a\nmodule that needs to do something each time Textadept creates a new buffer,\nconnect a Lua function to the `events.BUFFER_NEW` event:\n\n    events.connect(events.BUFFER_NEW, function()\n      -- Do something here.\n    end)\n\nEvents themselves are nothing special. You do not have to declare one before\nusing it. Events are simply strings containing arbitrary event names. When\neither you or Textadept emits an event, Textadept runs all event handlers\nconnected to the event, passing any given arguments to the event's handler\nfunctions. If an event handler explicitly returns a value that is not `nil`,\nTextadept will not call subsequent handlers. This is useful if you want to\nstop the propagation of an event like a keypress if your event handler\nhandled it, or if you want to use the event framework to pass values.\n
