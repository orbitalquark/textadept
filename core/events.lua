--- Textadept's core event structure and handlers.
--
-- Textadept emits events when you do things like create a new buffer, press a key, click on
-- a menu, etc. You can even emit events yourself using Lua. Each event has a set of event
-- handlers, which are simply Lua functions called in the order they were connected to an
-- event. For example, if you created a module that needs to do something each time Textadept
-- creates a new buffer, connect a Lua function to the `events.BUFFER_NEW` event:
--
--	events.connect(events.BUFFER_NEW, function()
--		-- Do something here.
--	end)
--
-- Events themselves are nothing special. You do not have to declare one before using it. Events
-- are simply strings containing arbitrary event names. When either you or Textadept emits an
-- event, Textadept runs all event handlers connected to the event, passing any given arguments
-- to the event's handler functions. If an event handler explicitly returns a value that is not
-- `nil`, Textadept will not call subsequent handlers. This is useful if you want to stop the
-- propagation of an event like a keypress if your event handler handled it, or if you want to
-- use the event framework to pass values.
-- @module events
local M = {}

--- Emitted when macOS tells Textadept to open a file.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *uri*: The UTF-8-encoded URI to open.
-- @field APPLEEVENT_ODOC

--- Emitted after deleting a character while an autocompletion or user list is active.
-- @field AUTO_C_CHAR_DELETED

--- Emitted when canceling an autocompletion or user list.
-- @field AUTO_C_CANCELED

--- Emitted after inserting an item from an autocompletion list into the buffer.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *text*: The selection's text.
-- - *position*: The autocompleted word's beginning position.
-- @field AUTO_C_COMPLETED

--- Emitted after selecting an item from an autocompletion list, but before inserting that item
-- into the buffer.
-- Automatic insertion can be canceled by calling `buffer:auto_c_cancel()` before returning
-- from the event handler.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *text*: The selection's text.
-- - *position*: The autocompleted word's beginning position.
-- @field AUTO_C_SELECTION

--- Emitted as items are highlighted in an autocompletion or user list.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *id*: Either the *id* from `buffer:user_list_show()` or `0` for an autocompletion list.
-- - *text*: The current selection's text.
-- - *position*: The position the list was displayed at.
-- @field AUTO_C_SELECTION_CHANGE

--- Emitted right after switching to another buffer.
-- The buffer being switched to is `buffer`.
-- Emitted by `view:goto_buffer()`.
-- @field BUFFER_AFTER_SWITCH

--- Emitted before replacing the contents of the current buffer.
-- Note that it is not guaranteed that `events.BUFFER_AFTER_REPLACE_TEXT` will be emitted
-- shortly after this event.
-- The buffer **must not** be modified during this event.
-- @field BUFFER_BEFORE_REPLACE_TEXT

--- Emitted right before switching to another buffer.
-- The buffer being switched from is `buffer`.
-- Emitted by `view:goto_buffer()`.
-- @field BUFFER_BEFORE_SWITCH

--- Emitted after replacing the contents of the current buffer.
-- Note that it is not guaranteed that `events.BUFFER_BEFORE_REPLACE_TEXT` was emitted previously.
-- The buffer **must not** be modified during this event.
-- @field BUFFER_AFTER_REPLACE_TEXT

--- Emitted after deleting a buffer.
-- Emitted by `buffer:delete()`.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *buffer*: Simple representation of the deleted buffer. Buffer operations cannot be performed
--	on it, but fields like `buffer.filename` can be read.
-- @field BUFFER_DELETED

--- Emitted after creating a new buffer.
-- The new buffer is `buffer`.

-- @field DOUBLE_CLICK

--- Emitted when the terminal version receives an unrecognized CSI sequence.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *cmd*: The 24-bit CSI command value. The lowest byte contains the command byte. The second

-- @field FIND_TEXT_CHANGED

--- Emitted when Textadept receives focus.
-- This event is never emitted when Textadept is running in the terminal.
-- @field FOCUS

--- Emitted after code folding is done by the lexer.

-- @field MODE_CHANGED

--- Emitted by the terminal version for an unhandled mouse event.
-- A handler should return `true` if it handled the event. Otherwise Textadept will try again.
-- (This side effect for a `false` or `nil` return is useful for sending the original mouse
-- event to a different view that a handler has switched to.)

-- - *button*: The mouse button number.

-- When connecting to this event, connect with an index of 1 if the handler needs to run before
-- Textadept closes all open buffers. If a handler returns `true`, Textadept does not quit. It is
-- not recommended to return `false` from a quit handler, as that may interfere with Textadept's
-- normal shutdown procedure.
-- Emitted by `quit()`.
-- @field QUIT

-- @field RESUME

--- Emitted after leaving a save point.
-- @field SAVE_POINT_LEFT

--- Emitted prior to suspending Textadept.
-- This event is only emitted by the terminal version.

-- Note that Textadept always displays a context menu on right-click.
-- Arguments:
--
-- - *index*: The numeric index of the clicked tab.
-- - *button*: The mouse button number that was clicked, either `1` (left button), `2` (middle
--	button), `3` (right button), `4` (wheel up), or `5` (wheel down).

--
--	+ `buffer.UPDATE_CONTENT`
