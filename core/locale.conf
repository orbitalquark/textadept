# American English localization file for Textadept.
#
# When translating this file into your native language, all translated text must
# be encoded in UTF-8. For each "key = value" line, please replace the "value"
# part with the translation of "key". Any whitespace around '=' is ignored.
#
# Note: for languages that support it, buttons and menu items may have a "_"
# before any single letter, which means that pressing the "Alt" modifier key
# along with that letter will activate (click) the button or menu item. You are
# free to use or omit these "_" mnemonics from your translations as you see fit.
