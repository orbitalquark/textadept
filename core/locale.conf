# When translating this file into your native language, all translated text must be encoded in
# UTF-8. For each "key = value" line, please replace the "value" part with the translation of
# "key". Any whitespace around '=' is ignored.
#
# Note: for languages that support it, buttons and menu items may have a "_" before any single
# letter, which means that pressing the "Alt" modifier key along with that letter will activate
# (click) the button or menu item. You are free to use or omit these "_" mnemonics from your
# translations as you see fit.
