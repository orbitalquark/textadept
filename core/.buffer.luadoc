-- This is a DUMMY FILE used for making LuaDoc for Buffers and Views.

--- A Textadept buffer or view object.
-- Constants are documented in the fields they apply to.
-- While you can work with individual buffer and view instances, it is really only useful to
-- work with the global one. (In fact, you are strongly discouraged from working with non-global
-- instances.)
-- Many of these functions and fields are derived from buffer- and view-specific functionality
-- of the Scintilla editing component, and additional information can be found on the [Scintilla
-- website](https://scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html).
-- Any buffer and view fields set on startup (e.g. in *~/.textadept/init.lua*) will be the
-- default, initial values for all buffers.
--
-- **Note:** This `buffer` and `view` API is largely interchangeable. That is, `view.`*field*
-- and `view:`*function* are often equivalent to `buffer.`*field* and `buffer:`*function*,
-- respectively. While this reference chooses one notation over the other, these choices are not
-- always strict requirements. Still, it is recommended to follow this convention. Functions
-- and fields related to manipulating buffer text and selections should use `buffer`, while
-- functions and fields related to displaying buffer text and other visuals should use `view`.

--- Map of color name strings to color values in `0xBBGGRR` format.
-- The contents of this map is typically set by a theme. Changing colors manually (e.g. via
-- the command entry) has no effect since colors are referenced by value, not name.
-- Note: for applications running within a terminal emulator, only 16 color values are recognized,
-- regardless of how many colors a user's terminal actually supports. (A terminal emulator's
-- settings determines how to actually display these recognized color values, which may end
-- up being mapped to a completely different color set.) In order to use the light variant of
-- a color, some terminals require a style's `bold` field must be set along with that normal
-- color. Recognized color values are black (0x000000), red (0x000080), green (0x008000), yellow
-- (0x008080), blue (0x800000), magenta (0x800080), cyan (0x808000), white (0xC0C0C0), light black

-- @table view.colors

--- Map of style names to style definition tables.
-- The contents of this map is typically set by a theme. If you are setting it manually (e.g. via
-- the command entry), call `view:set_styles()` to refresh the view and apply the styles.
--

--
-- - `view.STYLE_DEFAULT`: The default style all others are based on.

-- - `view.STYLE_CONTROLCHAR`: The style of control character blocks.
-- - `view.STYLE_INDENTGUIDE`: The style of indentation guides.

--	`lexer.TAG`, `lexer.TYPE`, `lexer.UNDERLINE`, `lexer.VARIABLE`, `lexer.VARIABLE_BUILTIN`:
--	Some common, predefined names many lexers use.
-- - Some lexers may use their own style names. To see the name of the style under the caret,
--	use the "Tools > Show Style" menu item.
--
-- Style definition tables may contain the following fields:
--
-- - `font`: String font name.
-- - `size`: Integer font size.
-- - `bold`: Whether or not the font face is bold. The default value is `false`.
-- - `weight`: Integer weight or boldness of a font, between 1 and 999.
-- - `italic`: Whether or not the font face is italic. The default value is `false`.
-- - `underline`: Whether or not the font face is underlined. The default value is `false`.
-- - `fore`: Font face foreground color in "0xBBGGRR" format.
-- - `back`: Font face background color in "0xBBGGRR" format.
-- - `eol_filled`: Whether or not the background color extends to the end of the line. The
--	default value is `false`.
-- - `case`: Font case: `view.CASE_UPPER` for upper, `view.CASE_LOWER` for lower, and
--	`view.CASE_MIXED` for normal, mixed case. The default value is `view.CASE_MIXED`.
-- - `visible`: Whether or not the text is visible. The default value is `true`.
-- - `changeable`: Whether the text is changeable instead of read-only. The default value is
--	`true`.
