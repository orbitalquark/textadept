# When translating this file into your native language, all translated text must

# part with the translation of "key". Any whitespace around '=' is ignored.

# Note: for languages that support it, buttons and menu items may have a "_"
# before any single letter, which means that pressing the "Alt" modifier key
# along with that letter will activate (click) the button or menu item. You are
