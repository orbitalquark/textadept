#### Overview

![Textadept](images/textadept.png)

Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and remarkably extensible cross-platform text editor for
programmers. Written in a combination of C and [Lua][] and relentlessly optimized for speed and
minimalism over the last 12+ years, Textadept is an ideal editor for programmers who want endless
extensibility without sacrificing speed and disk space, and without succumbing to code bloat and
a superabundance of features. The application has both a graphical user interface (GUI) version
that runs in a desktop environment, and a terminal version that runs within a terminal emulator.

[Lua]: https://www.lua.org

Textadept is _fast_. It starts up instantly and has a very responsive user interface. C code is
about as fast as you can get, and Lua is widely regarded as being one of the fastest scripting
languages available.

Textadept is minimalist. Not only is this evident in the editor's appearance, but its C core
is limited to around 2000 lines of code and its Lua extension code tries to avoid going beyond
4000 lines. After more than 12 years of development, Textadept contains [roughly the same amount
of code][] since its inception while significantly improving year after year.

[roughly the same amount of code]: index.html#plots

Textadept is remarkably extensible. It was designed to be that way from the beginning; the editor's
features came later. Most of Textadept's internals are written in Lua: syntax highlighting,
opening and saving files, and search and replace, to name a few. Textadept gives you nearly
complete control over the entire application using Lua. Capabilities like navigating within the
editor, changing menus and key bindings on the fly, handling core events, and highlighting the
syntax of new programming languages are possible. The editor's potential is seemingly limitless.

#### About This Manual

This manual uses the following typographical conventions:

* *Italic*: Used for filenames.
* `Constant width`: Used for environment variables, command line arguments, shell code, key
  bindings, and Lua code, including functions, tables, and variables.

Key bindings use the following modifier key representations:

Modifier | Windows, Linux, BSD | macOS | Terminal
-|-|-|-
Control | `Ctrl` | `^` | `^`
Alt | `Alt` | `⌥` | `M-`
Command | N/A | `⌘` | N/A
Shift | `Shift` | `⇧` | `S-`

This manual uses the following terminology:

* *buffer*: An object that contains editable text. Some other applications call this object a
  document or file.
* *view*: An object that displays a single buffer. Some other applications call this object
  a window.
* *caret*: The visual that represents the text insertion point. It is usually a blinking line.
* *module*: A package of Lua code that provides functionality for Textadept.
* *lexer*: A Lua module that highlights the syntax of source code written in a particular
  programming language. Textadept refers to a programming language by its lexer's name.

Finally, this manual assumes you are familiar enough with the [Lua][] programming language that
you can understand the simple code samples spread throughout the manual's contents. If you would
like to quickly get up to speed, or need a refresher, the excerpt from [Lua Quick Reference][]
may be of help.

#### ~/.textadept

Textadept stores all settings and user data in a local user directory that varies, depending
on the platform. This directory can also be configured using command line arguments. On
Windows systems, the default user directory is *C:\\Users\\username\\.textadept\\*
or *C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\.textadept\\*; on macOS, the default
user directory is */Users/username/.textadept/*; and on Linux and BSD, it is
*/home/username/.textadept/*. (Substitute *username* for your actual user name.)  From this point
forward, the manual will use *~/.textadept/* in place of any platform-specific user data directory.

There is a special file, *~/.textadept/init.lua*, that Textadept will create for you if it does
not already exist. This file is what you use to configure Textadept, specify your preferences,
and customize what the application does when it starts. For example, you can use this file to set
a color theme, specify default buffer and view settings, change the settings of existing modules,
load custom modules, configure key bindings, extend menus, enhance support for file types and
programming languages, and run arbitrary Lua code. These topics will be covered throughout
the manual. Textadept's comprehensive [Lua API][] lists, among other things, all configurable
settings for buffers, views, and modules.  You can open your *~/.textadept/init.lua* file via
`Ctrl+P` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘,` on macOS, and `M-~` in the terminal version.

Here is a simple *~/.textadept/init.lua* for illustration:

    -- Adjust the default theme's font and size.
    if not CURSES then
      view:set_theme('light', {font = 'DejaVu Sans Mono', size = 12})
    end

    -- Always use tabs for indentation.
    buffer.use_tabs = true
    buffer.tab_width = 4

    -- Always strip trailing spaces on save, automatically highlight the current
    -- word, and use C99-style line comments in C code.
    textadept.editing.strip_trailing_space = true
    textadept.editing.highlight_words = textadept.editing.HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT
    textadept.editing.comment_string.ansi_c = '//'

    -- Load an external module and bind a key to it.
    local ctags = require('ctags')
    keys.f12 = ctags.goto_tag

    -- Recognize .luadoc files as Lua code.
    textadept.file_types.extensions.luadoc = 'lua'

    -- Change the run commands for Lua and Python
    textadept.run.run_commands.lua = 'lua5.1 "%f"'
    textadept.run.run_commands.python = 'python3 "%f"'

    -- Always use PEP-8 indentation style for Python files.
    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      if name ~= 'python' then return end
      buffer.use_tabs = false
      buffer.tab_width = 4
    end)

**Note:** *~/.textadept/init.lua* must not call any functions that create buffers and views
(e.g. `ui.print()`, `io.open_file()`, and `buffer.new()`) at file-level scope. Buffers and
views can only be created within functions assigned to keys, associated with menu items, or
connected to events.

### Getting Started
---

#### Requirements

In its bid for minimalism, Textadept depends on very little to run. On Windows and macOS,
it has no external dependencies. On Linux and BSD, the GUI version depends only on [GTK][]
(a cross-platform GUI toolkit), and the terminal version depends only on a wide-character
implementation of curses like [ncurses][](w). Most Linux and BSD systems either already have
these dependencies installed, or they are readily available from a package manager.

Windows 7 (64-bit) and Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) are the minimum required operating systems. Linux
and BSD have no defined minimum.

[GTK]: https://gtk.org
[ncurses]: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html

#### Download

Textadept releases can be found [here][1]. Select the appropriate package for your platform. A
comprehensive list of changes between releases can be found [here][2]. You can also download
a separate set of modules that provide extra features and functionality to the core application.

**Windows Note:** antivirus software may flag the Windows package as containing a virus or
malware. This is a false-positive, likely due to Textadept's terminal version executable,
which is a console application.

The following table lists Textadept's approximate download and installation size for each platform.

Platform | Download Size | Installed Size
-|-|-
Linux | 4 MB | 8 MB
Windows | 21 MB | 57 MB (11 MB without bundled GTK Runtime)
macOS | 20 MB | 65 MB (9 MB without bundled GTK Runtime)

**Note:** each platform package contains two executables, one for the GUI version of Textadept,
and one for the terminal version.

[2]: changelog.html

#### Installation

Installing Textadept is simple and easy. You do not need administrator privileges. On Windows,
Linux, and BSD, simply unpack the archive anywhere. On macOS, unpack the archive and move
*Textadept.app* to your user or system *Applications/* directory like any other macOS
application. The macOS archive also contains a *ta* script for launching Textadept from the
command line. You can put this script somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g. */usr/local/bin/*),
but this is completely optional.

If you downloaded Textadept's extra set of modules, you can unpack its contents into Textadept's
directory (thus merging the *modules/* directories) on Windows, Linux, and BSD. On macOS, it
is recommended to create a *~/.textadept/* directory (if it does not already exist) and unpack
the modules there (thus creating or merging the *modules/* directory).

**Note:** Textadept generally does not auto-load [modules](#modules), so you will need to load
at least some of those extra modules manually. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    require('ctags')
    require('file_diff')
    require('spellcheck')

#### Updating

Textadept releases typically occur on the first day of the month every 1-2 months. There is no
auto-update process. (Textadept does not connect to the internet; it's just a text editor.) Simply
download the new version and copy its contents into your current installation, overwriting any
existing files and directories.

#### Running

![Linux](images/linux.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![macOS](images/macosx.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Win32](images/win32.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![curses](images/ncurses.png)

Run Textadept on Windows by double-clicking *textadept.exe* or *textadept-curses.exe*. On macOS,
double-click *Textadept.app* or invoke the *ta* script from the command line. On Linux and BSD,
invoke *textadept* or *textadept-curses* from a file browser, run dialog, terminal, etc.

For convenience, you can create shortcuts to the executables on the Windows Desktop, Start Menu,
Quick Launch toolbar, etc. On macOS, you can pin the app to your dock. On Linux and BSD, you can
create a symbolic link to the executables from somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g. */usr/local/bin/*)
or make a GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc. button or menu launcher. Textadept's *src/textadept.desktop*
and *src/textadept-curses.desktop* files may be of help.

Textadept accepts a variety of command line arguments, which are listed in the table below.

Option | Arguments | Description
-|:-:|-
`-e`, `--execute` | 1 | Run the given Lua code
`-f`, `--force` | 0 | Forces unique instance
`-h`, `--help` | 0 | Shows this<sup>a</sup>
`-l`, `--line` | 1 | Jumps to a line in the previously opened file
`-n`, `--nosession` | 0 | No state saving/restoring functionality
`-p`, `--preserve` | 0 | Preserve ^Q and ^S flow control sequences<sup>b</sup>
`-s`, `--session` | 1 | Loads the given session on startup
`-u`, `--userhome` | 1 | Sets alternate user data directory
`-v`, `--version` | 0 | Prints version and copyright info<sup>a</sup>

<sup>a</sup>The terminal version does not support these.<br/>
<sup>b</sup>Non-Windows terminal version only.

You can add your own command line arguments using [`args.register()`][]. For example, in your
*~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    args.register('-r', '--read-only', 0, function()
      events.connect(events.FILE_OPENED, function()
        buffer.read_only = true -- make all opened buffers read-only
      end)
      textadept.menu.menubar = nil -- hide the menubar
    end, "Read-only mode")

[`args.register()`]: api.html#args.register

Textadept can also open files and projects using the command line. For example:

    textadept /path/to/file1 ../relative/path/to/file2
    textadept /path/to/project/ relative/path/to/file1 relative/file2

Unless a filename is specified as an absolute path, Textadept assumes it is relative to
the application's current working directory (cwd). Textadept's cwd is initially the command
line's cwd. (If Textadept is not being run from the command line, its cwd is unspecified.) If a
project directory is specified, it becomes Textadept's cwd. (Textadept does not open all files
in that directory.)  If multiple project directories are specified, the last one becomes the cwd.

By default, Textadept saves its state when it exits. (This state consists of buffers and split
views that are open, the list of recently opened files, the application window's size and
maximized state, etc.) If Textadept is not given any files or projects to open, it will try to
restore its state at last exit.

**Tip:** you can explicitly tell Textadept to load a session by name using the `-s` or `--session`
command line argument. You can disable session functionality using `-n` or `--nosession`. Session
files are stored in *~/.textadept/*, and the default session name is "session".

The GUI version of Textadept is a single-instance application. This means that after you start
Textadept, any time you invoke it again (e.g. opening a file from a file browser or command
line), the action happens in the original instance. If you want to run separate instances of
Textadept, pass the `-f` or `--force` command line flag. On Windows, you can create a shortcut
to *textadept.exe* that passes this flag and use that shortcut to run Textadept. On Linux and
BSD, you can set up your button or menu launchers to pass the flag to the *textadept* executable.

Textadept can be run as a portable application. This is useful if, for example, you want to
install Textadept onto a flash drive and take it with you for use on multiple machines. Normally,
all settings and user data is stored in *~/.textadept/* (a local user directory that varies,
depending on the platform).  However, this user directory can be controlled using the `-u` or
`--userhome` command line argument. For example, invoking *textadept.exe* with the command line
arguments `-u userdata` will read from and store settings and user data to a *userdata/* directory
located inside an installation of Textadept. You can create a Windows shortcut that passes these
command line arguments to the Textadept executable and use that shortcut to run Textadept portably.

Textadept's user interface has been translated into a few different languages.  When the
application starts, it attempts to auto-detect your language settings by reading from the `$LANG`
environment variable. If Textadept cannot determine what language to use, or if it does not
support your language, it falls back on English. You can manually set your locale by copying
one of the locale configuration files from Textadept's *core/locales/* to your *~/.textadept/*
directory and renaming it *locale.conf*. If you would like to translate Textadept into your
language, please translate the English messages in *core/locale.conf* and send me (see README.md)
the modified file for inclusion in a future release.

**macOS Tip:** by default, macOS does not allow GUI applications like *Textadept.app* to see
shell environment variables like `$PATH`. (The terminal version is unaffected.) Consequently,
any features that utilize programs contained in `$PATH` (e.g. the programs in */usr/bin/*
or */usr/local/bin/*) will not find those programs. In order to work around this, Textadept
automatically invokes a user-created *~/.textadept/osx_env.sh* file when the application
starts. This script should export all of the environment variables you need Textadept to
see. For example:

    export PATH=$PATH

**Linux Note:** providing a single binary that runs on all Linux systems proves challenging,
since the versions of software installed vary widely from distribution to distribution. If you
get errors like:

  * `error while loading shared libraries: <lib>: cannot open shared object file: No such file
    or directory`
  * `/<path>/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_<version>' not found`

you will need to [compile](#compiling) Textadept manually for your system, which is a very
straightforward and easy process.

---
### User Interface
---

![UI](images/ui.png)

Textadept's user interface is sleek and simple. It consists of a menu bar, tab bar, editor
view, and statusbar. There is also a find & replace pane and a command entry, though Textadept
initially hides them both.

Textadept's titlebar shows the name and path of the current, active buffer. A '\*' character,
if present, indicates there are unsaved changes in that buffer.

#### Menu

The GUI version of Textadept has a completely customizable menu that provides access to nearly
all of the application's editing features.

**Tip:** Textadept is largely a keyboard-driven application, so nearly every menu item has a key
binding. For at least the GUI version in the English locale on Windows, Linux, and BSD, each
menu and menu item also has a unique mnemonic that can be used to activate it. For example,
`Alt+E` accesses the "Edit" menu, `S` opens the "Select" sub-menu, and `L` invokes the menu
item that selects the current line.

Textadept's menu is also accessible in the form of a searchable dialog via `Ctrl+Shift+E` on
Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧E` on macOS, and `M-S-C` in the terminal version. (Despite the
fact that the terminal version does not have a menu, it does have this dialog.) Typing part of
the name of any command in the dialog filters the list, with spaces being wildcards. The arrow
keys move the selection up and down. Pressing `Enter`, selecting `OK`, or double-clicking on a
command invokes it. (The terminal requires pressing `Enter`.) This feature is an alternative
to navigating the menus or remembering key bindings. It can also be used to quickly look up
key bindings for particular commands.

**Note:** for commands that have more than one key binding, only one of those bindings is shown
in the menu and dialog, and that binding is randomly chosen.

You can extend Textadept's menu with your own menus, sub-menus, and menu items by modifying
the [`textadept.menu.menubar`][] table. Any modifications will show up in the selection dialog
mentioned previously, even in the terminal version.  For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    local tools = textadept.menu.menubar[_L['Tools']]
    tools[#tools + 1] = {''} -- separator
    tools[#tools + 1] = {'Reset L_ua State', reset}

[`textadept.menu.menubar`]: api.html#textadept.menu.menubar

#### Tab Bar

The GUI version of Textadept has a tab bar that displays all of Textadept's open buffers by name,
though it is only visible when two or more buffers are open. A '\*' character, if present,
indicates there are unsaved changes in the marked buffer. There is only one tab bar for the
entire application, even if there are multiple split views. When two or more views are open, the
state of the tab bar applies only to the active view, and using the tab bar to switch between
files also applies only to that view. Right-clicking on the tab bar brings up a configurable
context menu that is defined by [`textadept.menu.tab_context_menu`][]. Tabs can be rearranged
by clicking on their tops and dragging and dropping them. You can turn off the tab bar by setting
[`ui.tabs`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    ui.tabs = false

[`textadept.menu.tab_context_menu`]: api.html#textadept.menu.tab_context_menu
[`ui.tabs`]: api.html#ui.tabs

Cycle to the next buffer via `Ctrl+Tab` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⇥` on macOS, and `M-N`
in the terminal version. Cycle to the previous buffer via `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, `^⇧⇥`, and `M-P`.

**Note:** Textadept does not currently support rearranging tabs (e.g. via drag and drop).

The tab bar is also accessible in the form of a searchable dialog via `Ctrl+B` on Windows,
Linux, and BSD, `⌘B` on macOS, and `M-B` or `M-S-B` in the terminal version. (Despite the
fact that the terminal version does not have a tab bar, it does have this dialog.) The dialog
displays a list of currently open buffers.  Typing part of any filename filters the list,
with spaces being wildcards. The arrow keys move the selection up and down. Pressing `Enter`,
selecting `OK`, or double-clicking on a buffer switches to it. (The terminal requires pressing
`Enter`.) This feature is particularly useful when many files are open, and navigating through
the tab bar is tedious.

![Buffer Browser](images/bufferbrowser.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Buffer Browser Filtered](images/bufferbrowserfiltered.png)

By default, the list shows buffers in the same order as the tab bar (the most recently opened
buffers are shown towards the bottom). You can configure the list to show the most recently
viewed buffers first by changing the key binding.  For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    keys['ctrl+b'] = function() ui.switch_buffer(true) end

#### Editor View

The editor view is where you will spend most of your time in Textadept. You can split it vertically
and horizontally as many times as you like, and you can view the same buffer in two or more
separate views. Lua also has near complete control over all views. The [`buffer`][] and [`view`][]
documentation lists everything you can do with buffers and views directly. Right-clicking inside
a view brings up a configurable context menu that is defined by [`textadept.menu.context_menu`][].

Split views can be dynamically resized by clicking and dragging on the splitter bar that
separates them. The following key bindings apply for split views:

* Split a view horizontally into top and bottom views via `Ctrl+Alt+S` or `Ctrl+Alt+H` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `^S` on macOS, and `M-^V S` in the terminal version.
* Split a view vertically into side-by-side views via `Ctrl+Alt+V` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
  `^V` on macOS, and `M-^V V` in the terminal version.
* Cycle to the next split view via `Ctrl+Alt+N` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌥⇥` on macOS,
  and `M-^V N` in the terminal version.
* Cycle to the previous split view via `Ctrl+Alt+P` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌥⇧⇥`
  on macOS, and `M-^V P` in the terminal version.
* Grow or shrink a view via `Ctrl+Alt++` or `Ctrl+Alt+-`, respectively, on Windows, Linux,
  and BSD; `^+` or `^-`, respectively, on macOS; and `M-^V +` or `M-^V -` in the terminal version.
* Unsplit the current view by removing its complement view(s) via `Ctrl+Alt+W` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `^W` on macOS, and `M-^V W` in the terminal version.
* Unsplit the current view by removing all other views via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W` on Windows, Linux,
  and BSD, `^⇧W` on macOS, and `M-^V S-W` in the terminal version.

**Note:** depending on the split sequence, the order when cycling between views may not be linear.

**Terminal version note:** `M-^V` is the key chain prefix for split views. Press and release
the prefix, and then type the next key in the chain by itself in order to perform the split
view action.

#### Find & Replace Pane

The find & replace pane is a compact, full-featured pane that allows you to quickly search
through files and directories. The pane is available only when you need it and quickly gets
out of your way when you do not, minimizing distractions.

You can summon the find & replace pane via `Ctrl+F` on Windows, Linux and BSD, `⌘F` on macOS,
and `M-F` or `M-S-F` in the terminal version. It has the usual find and replace functionality you
would expect, along with "Match Case", "Whole Word", "[Regex](#regex-and-lua-pattern-syntax)", and
"In Files" options.  The pane also stores find and replace history, up to 10 entries for each. As
you search, Textadept can automatically highlight all instances of found text in the current buffer
by setting [`ui.find.highlight_all_matches`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    ui.find.highlight_all_matches = true

**Note:** Textadept does not support multi-line regex searches.

While the pane is open in the GUI, the following key bindings apply:

* Perform "Find Next" and "Find Prev" in the "Find" entry via `Enter` and `Shift+Enter`,
  respectively.
* Perform "Replace" and "Replace All" in the "Replace" entry via `Enter` and `Shift+Enter`,
  respectively. When the "Regex" find option is enabled,

  + `\`*`n`* in the "Replace" entry represents the *n*th captured matching region's text, and
    `\0` represents all matched text.
  + `\U` and `\L` converts everything up to the next `\L`, `\U`, or `\E` to uppercase and
    lowercase, respectively. (`\E` turns off conversion.)
  + `\u` and `\l` converts the next character to uppercase and lowercase, respectively. These
    may appear within `\U` and `\L` constructs.

* For at least the English locale, toggle the find options using their button mnemonics: `Alt+M`,
  `Alt+W`, `Alt+X`, `Alt+I` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘M`, `⌘W`, `⌘X`, and `⌘I`,
  respectively, on macOS.
* Cycle through find/replace history via `Up` and `Down` on Windows, Linux, BSD, and the terminal
  version, and `⇡` and `⇣` on macOS.
* Hide the pane via `Esc`.

While the pane is open in the terminal version, the following key bindings apply:

* Switch between "Find" and "Replace" entries via `Down` and `Up`.
* Toggle between "Find Next" and "Find Prev" in the "Find" entry via `Tab`.
* Toggle between "Replace" and "Replace All" in the "Replace" entry via `Tab`.
* Perform the highlighted find/replace action via `Enter`.
* Toggle the find options via `F1`, `F2`, `F3`, and `F4`.
* Cycle through find/replace history via `^P` and `^N`.
* Erase the contents of the focused entry via `^U`.
* Hide the pane via `Esc`.

When the pane is closed, you can quickly perform "Find Next", "Find Prev", "Replace", and
"Replace All" via `Ctrl+G`, `Ctrl+Shift+G`, `Ctrl+Alt+R`, and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R`, respectively,
on Windows, Linux, and BSD; `⌘G`, `⌘⇧G`, `^R`, and `^⇧R`, respectively, on macOS; and
`M-G`, `M-S-G`, `M-R`, and `M-S-R` in the terminal version.

**Tip:** by default, "Replace All" replaces all text in the buffer. Selecting text and then
performing "Replace All" replaces all text in that selection only.

[`ui.find.highlight_all_matches`]: api.html#ui.find.highlight_all_matches

##### Find in Files

Textadept can search for text within multiple files and directories via `Ctrl+Shift+F` on
Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘⇧F` on macOS. (The terminal version does not have a default
key binding for finding in files.) Invoking "Find Next" prompts you for a directory to search
in. The "Replace" entry has been substituted for a "Filter" entry that contains files and
directories to include or exclude from the search.

A filter consists of a comma-separated list of [Lua patterns](#regex-and-lua-pattern-syntax)
that match filenames and directories to include or exclude. Patterns are inclusive by
default. Exclusive patterns begin with a '!'. If no inclusive patterns are given, any filename
is initially considered. As a convenience, file extensions can be specified literally instead
of as a Lua pattern (e.g. '.lua' vs. '%.lua$'), and '/' also matches the Windows directory
separator ('[/\\]' is not needed). The default filter excludes many common binary files and
version control directories from searches.

**Tip:** Textadept keeps track of filters set per-directory. You can also set per-directory filters
in Lua by modifying [`ui.find_in_files_filters`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    -- Only search in certain source directories.
    ui.find.find_in_files_filters['/path/to/project'] = {'/include', '/src'}

After performing a "Find in Files" search, a temporary buffer lists the search results. You can
use the arrow keys to navigate within the list and press `Enter` to jump to a result's location
in its respective file. You can also double-click on results or jump to the next or previous
result via `Ctrl+Alt+G` or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G`, respectively, on Windows, Linux, and BSD; and
`^⌘G` or `^⌘⇧G`, respectively, on macOS. (The terminal version does not have default key
bindings for these actions.)

[`ui.find_in_files_filters`]: api.html#ui.find.find_in_files_filters

##### Incremental Find

Textadept searches for text incrementally as you type when you summon the find & replace pane
via `Ctrl+Alt+F` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌘F` on macOS, and `M-^F` in the terminal
version. All of the find options apply except for "In Files".

#### Command Entry

The versatile command entry has many different roles. Its primary role is to execute Lua commands
and interact with Textadept's internal Lua state. In another context it filters text through
shell commands. [Lua extensions][] allow it to do even more. Like the find & replace pane,
the command entry pops in and out as you wish. Each role has its own history that can be cycled
through via the `Up` and `Down` key bindings on Windows, Linux, BSD, and the terminal version,
and `⇡` and `⇣` on macOS.

[Lua extensions]: api.html#ui.command_entry

##### Lua Command Entry

![Command Entry](images/commandentry.png)

You can open the Lua command entry via `Ctrl+E` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘E` on macOS, and
`M-C` in the terminal version. It acts very similarly to Lua's interactive prompt. Type in the Lua
command or code to run and press `Enter` to invoke or run it. Textadept's [Lua API][] contains
all of the application's built-in commands. For convenience, the contents of the [`buffer`][],
[`view`][], [`ui`][], and [`textadept`][] tables are considered to be global variables, the
first parameter to `buffer` and `view` functions may be omitted, and function call parentheses
can also be omitted. For example, instead of entering `buffer:append_text('foo')`, you can
enter `append_text('foo')`.  Instead of `view:split()`, you can simply use `split`. These
convenience facilities are not available in normally executed Lua code, such as code in
*~/.textadept/init.lua*.

**Warning:** if you try to cause instability of Textadept's Lua state, you will probably succeed,
so be careful.

The following key bindings apply in the Lua command entry:

* Show a documentation popup for the command under or behind the caret via `Ctrl+H` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `^H` on macOS, and `M-H` or `M-S-H` in the terminal version.
* Show completion candidates for Lua variables, tables, functions, and fields via `Tab` on
  Windows, Linux, BSD, and the terminal version, and `⇥` on macOS.  Use the arrow keys to
  make a selection and press `Enter` to insert it.

![Command Completion](images/commandentrycompletion.png)

You can specify on the command line Lua commands and code to run on startup using the `-e` and
`--execute` command line argument. This is useful when you want to run dynamic commands that
do not belong in *~/.textadept/init.lua*.

**Tip:** a side-effect of single-instance functionality in the GUI version of Textadept is that
you can remotely control the original instance of Textadept.  For example:

    ta ~/.textadept/init.lua &
    ta -e "events.emit(events.FIND, 'require')"

This will search for the first instance of the word "require" in the current file.

[`buffer`]: api.html#buffer
[`view`]: api.html#view
[`ui`]: api.html#ui
[`textadept`]: api.html#textadept

##### Shell Command Entry and Filtering Text

You can filter text through shell commands via `Ctrl+|` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘|`
on macOS, and `^\` in the terminal version. An example would be running the shell command
`sort`, which accepts lines in a buffer as standard input (stdin), sorts those lines, and then
emits them to standard output (stdout), which Textadept replaces the original input text with.
[`textadept.editing.filter_through()`][] describes how this feature determines stdin.

[`textadept.editing.filter_through()`]: api.html#textadept.editing.filter_through

#### Statusbar

The statusbar consists of two sections. The left section displays temporary status messages,
while the right section shows buffer status information. Buffer status information includes:

* The current line and column number.
* The lexer language name.
* The line ending mode, or EOL mode, which is either CRLF ("\r\n") or LF ('\n').  Line endings
  are the characters that separate lines.
* The indentation settings, which are a combination of an indentation character (either a tab
  or a space) and an indentation size (a measure of how many space characters are in one level
  of indentation). If tabs are used for indentation, then the indentation size is the number
  of space characters to draw for each tab character.
* The buffer's encoding. File and buffer encoding specifies how to interpret text bytes for
  display.

![Document Statusbar](images/docstatusbar.png)

### Working with Files and Projects
---

Textadept allows you to open files using a variety of methods:

* Open, using a standard file chooser dialog, one or more files in a single directory via
  `Ctrl+O` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘O` on macOS, and `^O` in the terminal version.
* Open, using a quick open dialog, one or more files in the current project or Textadept's
  current working directory via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌘⇧P` on
  macOS, and `M-^P` in the terminal version. Typing part of any filename filters the list,
  with spaces being wildcards. The arrow keys move the selection up and down. Holding down
  `Shift` while pressing the arrow keys selects multiple files, as does holding down `Ctrl`
  while clicking.  Pressing `Enter` or selecting `OK` opens all selected files. Double-clicking
  on a single file opens it. (The terminal requires pressing `Enter`.)
* Open, using a quick open dialog, one or more files in the directory of the currently opened
  file via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌘⇧O` on macOS, and `M-S-O`
  in the terminal version.
* Open a file by dragging it from a file manager and dropping it into one of Textadept's views.
* Open a recently opened file from a list of recent files via `Ctrl+Alt+O` on Windows, Linux,
  and BSD, `^⌘O` on macOS, and `M-^O` in the terminal version.
* Open, using a quick open dialog, one or more files in *~/.textadept/* via `Ctrl+U` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `⌘U` on macOS, and `^U` in the terminal version.
* Reopen the currently opened file, discarding any unsaved changes, via `Ctrl+Shift+O` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧O` on macOS, and `M-O` in the terminal version. Textadept will prompt
  you to reload a file if the editor detects it has been modified externally.

![Quick Open](images/snapopen.png)

When it comes to projects, Textadept's only concept of a project is a parent directory under
a recognized form of version control (Git, Mercurial, SVN, Bazaar, and Fossil). There is no
"Open Project" action. Textadept can work with multiple projects at once, since the current
project depends largely on context.  The current project is determined as follows:

1. If the current buffer is a file, its parent directory is searched for a version control
   directory. If none is found, that directory's parent directory is searched next, and so
   on. If a version control directory is found, its parent directory is the current project.
2. If Textadept's current working directory (cwd) contains a version control directory, that cwd
   is the current project. Otherwise, the cwd's parent directory is searched, just like in step 1.
3. If no version control directory is found, there is no current project.

**Tip:** you can specify Textadept's current working directory by passing it on the command
line when running the application. This effectively starts Textadept with a "default project".

By default, Textadept's quick open dialog displays nearly all types of files, and only the first
1000 files it finds. You can assign a project or directory-specific filter that indicates which
files to display for that project or directory by modifying [`io.quick_open_filters`][], and
you can specify a different maximum file list size that applies to all projects and directories
by setting [`io.quick_open_max`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    io.quick_open_filters['/path/to/project'] = {'/include', '/src'}
    io.quick_open_max = 10000 -- support huge projects

A filter consists of a comma-separated list of [Lua patterns](#regex-and-lua-pattern-syntax)
that match filenames and directories to include or exclude. Patterns are inclusive by
default. Exclusive patterns begin with a '!'. If no inclusive patterns are given, any filename
is initially considered. As a convenience, file extensions can be specified literally instead
of as a Lua pattern (e.g. '.lua' vs. '%.lua$'), and '/' also matches the Windows directory
separator ('[/\\]' is not needed). The default filter excludes many common binary files and
version control directories from searches.

You can mimic a more traditional approach to projects by saving and loading project-specific
sessions via the "File > Save Session..." and "File > Load Session..." menu items, respectively. A
session can be loaded on startup using the `-s` or `--session` command line argument.

[`io.quick_open_filters`]: api.html#io.quick_open_filters
[`io.quick_open_max`]: api.html#io.quick_open_max

##### Language

When Textadept opens a file, it automatically attempts to identify the programming language
associated with that file and assigns a lexer to perform syntax highlighting of the file's
contents. The identification process is as follows:

1. The first line of the file is checked against any Lua patterns in
   [`textadept.file_types.patterns`][]. If there is a match, the lexer associated with that
   matching pattern is used.
2. The file's extension is checked against any of the extensions in
   [`textadept.file_types.extensions`][]. If there is a match, the lexer associated with that
   matching extension is used. If the file does not have an extension, the entire file name is
   used in the check.

You can associate first line patterns, file extensions, and file names with lexers by modifying
[`textadept.file_types.patterns`][] and [`textadept.file_types.extensions`][]. For example,
in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.file_types.patterns['^#!.+/zsh'] = 'bash'
    textadept.file_types.extensions.luadoc = 'lua'

Textadept has lexers for more than 100 different programming languages and recognizes hundreds
of file types. In the event that your programming language is not understood, you can write a
[lexer][] for it, place that lexer in your *~/.textadept/lexers/* directory, and add an extension
and/or pattern for it.

For a given lexer name, Textadept attempts to find, in order, that lexer from the following
locations:

1. Your *~/.textadept/lexers/* directory.
2. Textadept's *lexers/* directory.

**Tip:** placing lexers in your user data directory avoids the possibility of you overwriting
them when you update Textadept. These lexers also take precedence over the ones installed
with Textadept.

You can manually change a buffer's lexer via `Ctrl+Shift+L` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧L`
on macOS, and `M-S-L` in the terminal version. Typing part of a lexer name in the dialog filters
the list, with spaces being wildcards. The arrow keys move the selection up and down. Pressing
`Enter`, selecting `OK`, or double-clicking on a lexer assigns it to the current buffer. (The
terminal requires pressing `Enter`.)

[`textadept.file_types.patterns`]: api.html#textadept.file_types.patterns
[`textadept.file_types.extensions`]: api.html#textadept.file_types.extensions
[lexer]: api.html#lexer

##### Encoding

Textadept has the ability to work with files encoded in one of many different encodings, but by
default it only attempts to read UTF-8, ASCII, CP1252, and UTF-16 files, in that order. If you work
with files that have other encodings, you will need to add them to [`io.encodings`][], Textadept's
known encoding list, before attempting to open one. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    io.encodings[#io.encodings + 1] = 'UTF-32'
    table.insert(io.encodings, 3, 'Macintosh') -- before CP1252

You can convert a buffer's encoding using the "Buffer > Encoding" menu or
[`buffer.set_encoding()`][]. You can extend the menu to include more encodings.  For example,
in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    local menu = textadept.menu.menubar[_L['Buffer']][_L['Encoding']]
    local encoding = 'UTF-32'
    menu[#menu + 1] = {encoding, function() buffer:set_encoding(encoding) end}

The default encoding for new buffers is UTF-8, due to its wide support in other text editors
and all modern operating systems.

[`io.encodings`]: api.html#io.encodings
[`buffer.set_encoding()`]: api.html#buffer.set_encoding

##### Buffer Settings

Textadept attempts to auto-detect a file's line end mode (EOL mode), falling back on CRLF
("\r\n") by default on Windows, and LF ('\n') on all other platforms. You can manually change
the line ending mode using the "Buffer > EOL Mode" menu.

Textadept does not attempt to auto-detect a file's indentation. The default indentation setting
is two spaces, but you can specify your preferred indentation settings globally, and on a
language-specific basis. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    -- Default indentation settings for all buffers.
    buffer.use_tabs = true
    buffer.tab_width = 8

    -- Indentation settings for individual languages.
    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      if name == 'python' then
        buffer.use_tabs = false
        buffer.tab_width = 4
      elseif name == 'ruby' or name == 'yaml' then
        buffer.use_tabs = false
        buffer.tab_width = 2
      end
    end)

You can manually change a buffer's indentation using the following process:

1. Toggle between using tabs and spaces via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
   `^⇧T` on macOS, and `M-T` or `M-S-T` in the terminal version.
2. Set the indentation size via the "Buffer > Indentation" menu.
3. Optionally convert existing indentation to the new indentation settings via `Ctrl+Alt+I`
   on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^I` on macOS, and `M-I` in the terminal version.

##### View Settings

Textadept normally does not wrap long lines into view, nor does it show whitespace characters. You
can toggle line wrapping for the current buffer via `Ctrl+Alt+\` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and
`^\` on macOS. You can toggle whitespace visibility for the current buffer via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`
on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `^⇧S` on macOS. Visible spaces are represented by dots,
and visible tabs are represented by arrows. (The terminal version does not have default key
bindings for either of these actions.)

The GUI version of Textadept can show small guiding lines based on indentation level, and
does so by default. You can toggle the visibility of these guides for the current view via
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `^⇧I` on macOS.

The GUI version of Textadept also allows you to temporarily increase or decrease the font size
in the current view. The following key bindings apply for this feature:

* Increase the view's font size via `Ctrl+=` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘=` on macOS.
* Decrease the view's font size via `Ctrl+-` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘-` on macOS.
* Reset the view's font size to its normal value via `Ctrl+0` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and
  `⌘0` on macOS.

### Adept Editing
---

Textadept implements most of the customary key bindings for navigating text fields on each
platform, including Bash-style bindings on macOS and in the terminal version. The editor also
implements most of the usual basic editing key bindings (e.g. undo, redo, cut, copy, paste,
etc.). All of Textadept's navigation-related key bindings are listed in the "Movement" section
of the [key bindings list][]. Textadept's basic editing key bindings are listed in the "Edit"
section of that list. (They are also shown in the "Edit" menu.)

[key bindings list]: api.html#textadept.keys

#### Brace Matching, Auto-pair, and Typeover

Textadept automatically highlights matching brace characters when the caret is over one of them:
'(', ')', '[', ']', '{', or '}'. You can jump to the current character's complement via `Ctrl+M`
on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^M` on macOS, and `M-M` in the terminal version. You can add
highlighting for '<' and '>' by modifying [`textadept.editing.brace_matches`][]. For example,
in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.editing.brace_matches[string.byte('<')] = true
    textadept.editing.brace_matches[string.byte('>')] = true

![Matching Braces](images/matchingbrace.png)

Since braces often go together in pairs, Textadept automatically inserts the complement of
opening brace characters you type, deletes that complement if you press `Backspace`, and
moves over the complement if you type it (as opposed to inserting it again). Textadept also
exhibits this behavior for single and double quote characters ('&apos;' and '&quot;'). You
can configure or disable this behavior by modifying [`textadept.editing.auto_pairs`][] and
[`textadept.editing.typeover_chars`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    -- Auto-pair and typeover '<' and '>'.
    textadept.editing.auto_pairs[string.byte('<')] = '>'
    textadept.editing.typeover_chars[string.byte('>')] = true

    -- Disable auto-pair and typeover.
    textadept.editing.auto_pairs = nil
    textadept.editing.typeover_chars = nil

[`textadept.editing.brace_matches`]: api.html#textadept.editing.brace_matches
[`textadept.editing.auto_pairs`]: api.html#textadept.editing.auto_pairs
[`textadept.editing.typeover_chars`]: api.html#textadept.editing.typeover_chars

#### Word Highlight

Textadept can be configured to automatically highlight all occurrences of the word under
the caret, or all occurrences of the selected word (e.g. a variable name), by setting
[`textadept.editing.highlight_words`][]. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    -- Highlight all occurrences of the current word.
    textadept.editing.highlight_words = textadept.editing.HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT
    -- Highlight all occurrences of the selected word.
    textadept.editing.highlight_words = textadept.editing.HIGHLIGHT_SELECTED

Pressing `Esc` clears highlighting. By default, Textadept does not perform any automatic
highlighting.

![Word Highlight](images/wordhighlight.png)

[`textadept.editing.highlight_words`]: api.html#textadept.editing.highlight_words

#### Autocompletion and Documentation

Textadept provides buffer-based word completion. It can also autocomplete symbols for programming
languages and display documentation for functions and other symbols.

You can show word completion candidates for partially-typed words via `Ctrl+Enter` on Windows,
Linux, and BSD, `^Esc` on macOS, and `M-Enter` in the terminal version. Continuing to type
changes the suggested completion. Use the arrow keys to navigate within the list and press
`Enter` to insert the rest of the selected word. By default, the list of completions comes
from the current buffer. You can configure Textadept to look in all open buffers by setting
[`textadept.editing.autocomplete_all_words`][]. For example, in *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.editing.autocomplete_all_words = true

![Word Completion](images/wordcompletion.png)

For languages that support it, you can show symbol completion candidates at the current position
via `Ctrl+Space` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌥Esc` on macOS, and `^Space` in the terminal
version.

![Autocomplete Lua](images/adeptsense_lua.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Autocomplete Lua String](images/adeptsense_string.png)

Also for languages that support it, you can show any known documentation for the current symbol
via `Ctrl+H` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^H` on macOS, and `M-H` or `M-S-H` in the terminal
version. Textadept has built-in autocompletion and documentation support for Lua and C, including
for its own Lua API.

![Documentation](images/adeptsense_doc.png)

Textadept's framework for providing symbol autocompletion and documentation relies on
[autocompleter][] functions and [API files][], which are often supplied by [language][]
[modules](#modules). You can use this framework to write your own autocompletion routines.

[`textadept.editing.autocomplete_all_words`]: api.html#textadept.editing.autocomplete_all_words
[autocompleter]: api.html#textadept.editing.autocompleters
[API files]: api.html#textadept.editing.api_files
[language]: api.html#_M

#### Text Selections

Textadept has three kinds of text selections: contiguous, multiple, and rectangular.

You can create contiguous selections as follows:

* Make an arbitrary selection anchored at the caret by pressing the arrow keys, home/end, page
  up/down, etc. while holding down the `Shift` key, or by simply clicking and dragging the mouse.
* The terminal version can also make an arbitrary selection by entering selection mode via `^^`
  and using normal movement keys. This feature is available since some terminals do not recognize
  `Shift` with movement keys.  While in selection mode, swap the start and end positions via
  `^]` in order to alter the selection from its opposite side. Exit selection mode by typing
  text, deleting text, performing an action that changes text, or by pressing `^^` again.
* Select the current word via `Ctrl+Shift+D` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧D` on macOS, and
  `M-S-W` in the terminal version. Repeated use of this action selects subsequent occurrences
  of that word as additional (multiple) selections.
* Select the current line via `Ctrl+Shift+N` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧N` on macOS,
  and `M-S-N` in the terminal version.
* Double click to select a word, and triple-click to select a line.
* Click and optionally drag within the line number margin to select whole lines.
* Select the current paragraph via `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧P` on macOS,
  and `M-S-P` in the terminal version. Paragraphs are surrounded by one or more blank lines.
* Select all buffer text via `Ctrl+A` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘A` on macOS, and `M-A`
  in the terminal version.
* Select text between matching delimiters (parentheses, brackets, braces, single quotes,
  double-quotes, and back quotes) via `Ctrl+Shift+M` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⇧M` on
  macOS, and `M-S-M` in the terminal version. Repeated use of this action toggles the selection
  of the delimiters themselves.
* Select between HTML/XML tags via `Ctrl+<` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘<` on macOS, and
  `M-<` in the terminal version.
* Select an HTML/XML tag via `Ctrl+>` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘>` on macOS.

You can create multiple selections as follows:

* Add another selection by holding down `Ctrl`, clicking, and optionally dragging the mouse
  over a range of text.
* Select as an additional selection the next occurrence of the current word via `Ctrl+Shift+D`
  on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧D` on macOS, and `M-S-W` in the terminal version.

Textadept mirrors any typed text at each selection.

You can create a rectangular selection as follows:

* Press the arrow keys, home/end, or page up/down, while holding down `Alt+Shift` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `⌥⇧` on macOS, and `M-S-` in the terminal version.
* Click and drag the mouse while holding down the `Alt` key on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and
  `⌥` on macOS.
* Click and drag the mouse without holding down any modifiers (thus making a normal, multi-line
  selection), press and hold down the `Alt` key on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌥` on macOS, and
  `M-` in the terminal version, and then continue dragging the mouse. This feature is available
  because some window managers in Linux consume `Alt+Shift` + arrow keys and `Alt` + mouse drag.

You are permitted to create a zero-width rectangular selection that spans multiple lines,
and for this kind of selection, Textadept mirrors any typed text on all of those lines.

![Rectangular Selection](images/rectangularselection.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Rectangular Edit](images/rectangularselection2.png)

You can also copy rectangular blocks of text and paste them into rectangular blocks of the
same size.

**Note:** macOS does not support the direct pasting rectangular selections. Instead, use the
[Lua Command Entry](#lua-command-entry) and enter `replace_rectangular(ui.clipboard_text)`
after copying a block of text.

#### Text Transformations

Textadept can apply many different transformations to the current word, line, and selected text.

* Enclose the current word or selected text within delimiters like parentheses, braces, brackets,
  single quotes, double quotes, or HTML/XML tags using the key bindings listed in the "Edit >
  Selection" submenu.
* Convert the selected text to upper or lower case via `Ctrl+Alt+U` or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U`,
  respectively, on Windows, Linux, and BSD; `^U` or `^⇧U`, respectively, on macOS; and `M-^U`
  or `M-^L` in the terminal version.
* Increase or decrease the indentation of the selected lines via `Tab` or `Shift+Tab`,
  respectively, on Windows, Linux, and BSD; `⇥` or `⇧⇥`, respectively on macOS; and `Tab`
  or `S-Tab` in the terminal version. You do not have to select whole lines; selecting any part
  of a line is sufficient.
* Move the current or selected line(s) up or down via `Ctrl+Shift+Up` or `Ctrl+Shift+Down`,
  respectively, on Windows, Linux, and BSD; `^⇧⇡` or `^⇧⇣`, respectively, on macOS;
  and `S-^Up` or `S-^Down` in the terminal version. You do not have to select whole lines;
  selecting any part of a line is sufficient.
* Comment out code on the current or selected line(s) via `Ctrl+/` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
  `⌘/` on macOS, and `M-/` in the terminal version. You do not have to select whole lines;
  selecting any part of a line is sufficient.

You can auto-enclose selected text between any typed punctuation character (taking into account
[`textadept.editing.auto_pairs`][]) by setting [`textadept.editing.auto_enclose`][]. For example,
in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.editing.auto_enclose = true

[`textadept.editing.auto_pairs`]: api.html#textadept.editing.auto_pairs
[`textadept.editing.auto_enclose`]: api.html#textadept.editing.auto_enclose

#### Navigate Through History

Textadept records buffer positions within views over time and allows for navigating through
that history. Navigate backward or forward via `Alt+,` or `Alt+.`, respectively, on Windows,
Linux, and BSD; `^,` or `^.`, respectively, on macOS; and `M-,` or `M-.`, respectively, in the
terminal version.

#### Goto Line

You can jump to a specific line in the current buffer via `Ctrl+J` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
`⌘J` on macOS, and `^J` in the terminal version. Enter the line number to jump to in the
prompt, and press `Enter` or click `OK`.

#### Bookmarks

Bookmarks are markers attached to lines of interest. They move in sync with the lines they were
added to as buffer text is inserted and deleted. Bookmarks show up in the left-hand margin
after line numbers. Textadept allows you to bookmark lines and jump back to them later. The
following key bindings apply for bookmarks:

* Toggle a bookmark on the current line via `Ctrl+F2` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘F2`
  on macOS, and `F1` in the terminal version.
* Jump to the next bookmarked line via `F2`.
* Jump to the previously bookmarked line via `Shift+F2` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⇧F2`
  on macOS, and `F3` in the terminal version.
* Jump to the bookmarked line selected from a list via `Alt+F2` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
  `⌥F2` on macOS, and `F4` in the terminal version.
* Clear all bookmarks in the current buffer via `Ctrl+Shift+F2` on Windows, Linux, and BSD,
  `⌘⇧F2` on macOS, and `F6` in the terminal version.

#### Macros

Macros allow you to quickly record a series of edits and play them back without having to write
a custom Lua script. The following key bindings apply for macros:

* Start recording a macro via `F9`.
* Stop recording a macro via `Shift+F9` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⇧F9` on macOS, and `F10`
  in the terminal version.
* Play back the most recently recorded macro via `Alt+F9` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌥F9`
  on macOS, and `F12` in the terminal version.

You can use the "Tools > Macros" menu to save the most recently recorded macro to a file,
and to load one for playback on demand.

#### Snippets

Snippets are dynamic text templates that can be inserted into the buffer on demand. They
are composed of any combination of plain text, placeholders for interactive input, mirrors
and transforms for interactive input, and arbitrary Lua and Shell code. Snippets eliminate
the need for typing repetitive code constructs like class definitions, getters and setters,
control structures, API calls, and more.

![Snippet](images/snippet.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Snippet Expanded](images/snippet2.png)

A snippet has a trigger word associated with snippet text in the [`snippets`][]
table. Language-specific snippets are in a subtable assigned to their language's lexer name, and
are often supplied by [language][] [modules](#modules). Snippets may also be the contents of files
in a snippet directory, with file names being the trigger word. The [snippets documentation][]
describes snippets and their contents in more detail.

The following key bindings apply for snippets:

* Insert a snippet from a list of available snippets via `Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows, Linux, and
  BSD, `⌥⇧⇥` on macOS, and `M-S-K` in the terminal version.  Typing part of a snippet
  trigger in the dialog filters the list, with spaces being wildcards. The arrow keys move
  the selection up and down. Pressing `Enter`, selecting `OK`, or double-clicking on a snippet
  inserts it into the current buffer. (The terminal requires pressing `Enter`.)
* Show completion candidates for a partially-typed snippet trigger word via `Ctrl+K` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `⌥⇥` on macOS, and `M-K` in the terminal version. Continuing to type
  changes the suggested completion. Use the arrow keys to navigate within the list and press
  `Enter` to insert the rest of the trigger word.
* Insert a snippet based on the trigger word behind the caret via `Tab` on Windows, Linux,
  BSD, and in the terminal version, and `⇥` on macOS. You can insert another snippet within
  an active snippet. A previously active snippet will pick up where it left off after a nested
  snippet finishes.
* Navigate to the next placeholder in the current snippet via `Tab` on Windows, Linux, BSD,
  and in the terminal version, and `⇥` on macOS.
* Navigate to the previous placeholder in the current snippet via `Shift+Tab` on Windows, Linux,
  and BSD, `⇧⇥` on macOS, and `S-Tab` in the terminal version.  If there is no previous
  placeholder, the current snippet is canceled.
* Cancel the current snippet via `Esc`.

#### Code Folding

Textadept can temporarily hide blocks of code in supported languages. Markers in the margin to
the left of code denote fold points. Clicking on those markers toggles folding. You can toggle
folding for the current block via `Ctrl+*` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘*` on macOS, and
`M-*` in the terminal version.

![Folding](images/folding.png)

#### Virtual Space

Textadept normally constrains the caret to remain within text lines. Enabling virtual space
allows you to move the caret into the space beyond the ends of lines. Toggle virtual space via
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `^⇧V` in macOS. (The terminal version does
not have a default key binding for toggling virtual space.)

#### Key Bindings

Key bindings are simply commands (Lua functions) assigned to key sequences in the [`keys`][]
table. Key sequences are composed of an ordered combination of modifier keys followed by either
the key's inserted character or, if no such character exists, the string representation of
the key according to [`keys.KEYSYMS`][]. Language-specific keys are in a subtable assigned to
their language's lexer name, and are often supplied by [language][] [modules](#modules). Key
sequences can also be assigned tables of key bindings to create key chains (e.g. Emacs `C-x`
prefix). Key bindings can be grouped into modes such that while a mode is active, Textadept
ignores all key bindings outside that mode until the mode is unset (e.g. Vim-style modal
editing). The [keys documentation][] describes all of this in more detail.

### Compile, Run, Build, and Test
---

Textadept knows most of the commands that compile and/or run code in source files. It also
knows some of the commands that build projects, and you can tell the editor how to run your
project's test suite. Textadept recognizes many of the warning and error messages emitted by
those commands and marks them as they occur in compile/run/build/test output. Double-clicking
on a line with a warning or error jumps to its source.

The following key bindings apply for compiling and running source files, and for building
projects and running tests:

* Compile the current file via `Ctrl+Shift+R` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧R` on macOS,
  and `M-^R` in the terminal version.
* Run the current file via `Ctrl+R` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘R` on macOS, and `^R`
  in the terminal version.
* Set, using an interactive dialog, the command line arguments for the current file's compile
  and run commands via `Ctrl+Shift+A` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, and `⌘⇧A` on macOS. (The
  terminal version does not have a default key binding for setting command line arguments.) Enter
  the command line arguments for each command and press `Enter` or click `OK`.
* Build the current project via `Ctrl+Shift+B` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧B` on macOS,
  and `M-^B` in the terminal version.
* Run tests for the current project via `Ctrl+Shift+T` on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧T`
  on macOS, and `M-^T` in the terminal version.
* Stop the currently running compile, run, build, or test process via `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows,
  Linux, and BSD, `⌘⇧X` on macOS, and `M-^X` in the terminal version.
* Jump to the source of the next recognized warning or error via `Ctrl+Alt+E` on Windows, Linux,
  and BSD, `^⌘E` on macOS, and `M-X` in the terminal version.
* Jump to the source of the previously recognized warning or error via `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E`
  on Windows, Linux, and BSD, `^⌘⇧E` on macOS, and `M-S-X` in the terminal version.
* Jump to the source of the recognized warning or error on the current line via `Enter`.

![Runtime Error](images/runerror.png)

When you execute a compile, run, build, or test command, that command's output is printed to
a temporary buffer in real-time. You can configure Textadept to print output in the background
by setting [`textadept.run.run_in_background`][].  For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.run.run_in_background = true

You can change or add compile, run, build, and test commands by modifying
the [`textadept.run.compile_commands`][], [`textadept.run.run_commands`][],
[`textadept.run.build_commands`][], and [`textadept.run.test_commands`][] tables,
respectively. You can add Lua patterns that recognize warning and error output by modifying the
[`textadept.run.error_patterns`][] table. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    textadept.run.compile_commands.foo = 'foo "%f"'
    textadept.run.run_commands.foo = './"%e"'
    textadept.run.error_patterns.foo = {'^(.-):(%d+): (.+)$'} -- bar.foo:1: oops

    textadept.run.build_commands['/path/to/project'] = 'make -C src -j4'
    textadept.run.test_commands['/path/to/project'] = 'lua tests.lua'

**Tip:** you can set compile and run commands on a per-filename basis, and these commands can
contain arguments so that you do not have to invoke "Tools > Set Arguments..."

---
### Modules
---

Modules are packages of Lua code that provide functionality for Textadept. Most of the
editor's features come from individual modules (see Textadept's *core/* and *modules/*
directories). Textadept can load modules when the application starts up, or it can load modules
on-demand in response to events. Once a module is loaded, it persists in memory and is never
unloaded. Textadept attempts to load, in order, a given module from the following locations:

1. Your *~/.textadept/modules/* directory.
2. Textadept's *modules/* directory.

**Tip:** placing modules in your user data directory avoids the possibility of you overwriting
them when you update Textadept. These modules also take precedence over the ones installed
with Textadept.

Textadept will only load modules it is explicitly told to load (e.g. from your
*~/.textadept/init.lua*). For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    local ctags = require('ctags')
    ctags.f12 = ctags.goto_tag

    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      if name == 'lua' then require('lua.extras') end
    end)

The only exception to this auto-loading prohibition is modules that have the same name as a
lexer language. These so-called "[language modules][]" will be automatically loaded when an
appropriate source file is opened, or when the module's associated lexer is loaded for a buffer.

**Note:** lexer language names are typically the names of lexer files in your
*~/.textadept/lexers/* directory and Textadept's *lexers/* directory.

#### Developing Modules

Modules follow the Lua package model: a module is either a single Lua file or a group of Lua files
in a directory that contains an *init.lua* file (which is the module's entry point). The name
of the module is its file name or directory name, respectively. Here are some basic guidelines
for developing modules and some things to keep in mind:

* Modules should return a table of functions and fields that are defined locally, rather than
  globally. (This is standard Lua practice.) That way, the construct `local foo = require('foo')`
  behaves as expected.
* Modules should not define global variables, as all modules share the same Lua state.
* Only [language modules][] should be named after lexer languages.
* Modules must not call any functions that create buffers and views (e.g.  `ui.print()`,
  `io.open_file()`, and `buffer.new()`) at file-level scope.  Buffers and views can only be
  created within functions assigned to keys, associated with menu items, or connected to events.
* Additional documentation on creating language modules can be found in the the [language
  modules][] documentation.

**Tip:** you do not need to have a language module in order to have language-specific editing
features. You can simply put language-specific features inside an [`events.LEXER_LOADED`][]
event handler. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    -- Auto-pair and brace-match '<' and '>' only in HTML and XML files.
    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      local is_markup = name == 'html' or name == 'xml'
      textadept.editing.auto_pairs[string.byte('<')] = is_markup and '>'
      textadept.editing.brace_matches[string.byte('<')] = is_markup
      textadept.editing.brace_matches[string.byte('>')] = is_markup
    end)

[language modules]: api.html#_M
[`events.LEXER_LOADED`]: api.html#events.LEXER_LOADED

---
### Themes
---

Themes customize Textadept's look and feel. The editor comes with three built-in themes:
"light", "dark", and "term". The default theme for the GUI and terminal versions is "light"
and "term", respectively.

<span style="display: block; clear: right;"></span>

![Light Theme](images/lighttheme.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Dark Theme](images/darktheme.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Term Theme](images/termtheme.png)

A theme consists of a single Lua file, and is typically responsible for:

* Defining the [colors][] and [text display settings][] (styles) used in syntax highlighting.
* Assigning colors to various UI elements such as the caret, text selections, margin markers,
  and documentation popups.
* Specifying what symbols to use for margin markers and how to display visual elements like
  the brace match indicator and snippet placeholders.
* Specifying the find & replace pane entry font name and size.

[colors]: api.html#lexer.colors
[text display settings]: api.html#lexer.styles

Textadept attempts to load, in order, a given theme from the following locations:

1. Your *~/.textadept/themes/* directory.
2. Textadept's *themes/* directory.

**Tip:** placing themes in your user data directory avoids the possibility of you overwriting
them when you update Textadept. These themes also take precedence over the ones installed
with Textadept.

You can set Textadept's theme using [`view.set_theme()`][]. You can also tweak a theme's styles
on a per-language basis. For example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    if not CURSES then
      view:set_theme('light', {font = 'DejaVu Sans Mono', size = 12})
    end

    -- Color Java functions black instead of the default orange.
    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      if name ~= 'java' then return end
      local default_fore = view.style_fore[view.STYLE_DEFAULT]
      view.style_fore[buffer:style_of_name('function')] = default_fore
    end)

**Tip:** you can experiment with themes without having to restart Textadept by using the
[`reset()`][] command in the [Lua Command Entry](#lua-command-entry).  Once you make changes
to either your *~/.textadept/init.lua* or theme file, issuing the `reset` command will reload
your changes.

[`view.set_theme()`]: api.html#view.set_theme
[`reset()`]: api.html#reset

The widgets in the GUI version of Textadept cannot be themed using Lua theme files. Instead, you
must use [GTK Themes][] or [GTK CSS][], which are part of the GUI toolkit Textadept uses. The
exception to this is find & replace entry font, which can be changed. For Windows and macOS,
place themes in Textadept's *share/themes/* directory and edit *etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini*
to set the `gtk-theme-name` to the directory name of your theme.

[GTK CSS]: https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/css-overview.html

---
### Scripting
---

Nearly every aspect of Textadept can be scripted, or controlled, using Lua.  Textadept contains
its own internal copy of [Lua 5.3][], which is largely unmodified compared to the official Lua
release. The main difference is that Textadept's Lua does not have any compatibility options
turned on for previous versions of Lua.

Being an event-driven application, Textadept simply responds to input like key presses,
mouse clicks, and state changes by running Lua code (more specifically, executing Lua
functions). For example, when you press a key, Textadept emits an `events.KEYPRESS` event, which
its *core/keys.lua* is listening for. When a sequence like `Ctrl+O` on Windows, Linux, and BSD
is recognized, *core/keys.lua* looks up which Lua function is assigned to the `keys['ctrl+o']`
key. By default, it is `io.open_file()`, so that function is executed and the user is prompted
for a file to open. You could bind a different function to that key and Textadept will duly
execute it. Similarly, when the editor opens a file via `io.open_file()`, that function emits a
`events.FILE_OPENED` event, which *modules/textadept/file_types.lua* is listening for. When a
Lua file is opened, *modules/textadept/file_types.lua* designates the "lua" lexer to perform
syntax highlighting on that file and also loads the Lua language module if it has not already
been loaded. You could also listen for `events.FILE_OPENED` in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*
and perform your own action, such as loading some project-specific tools for editing that file.

Your *~/.textadept/init.lua* is the entry point to scripting Textadept. In this file you can set
up custom key bindings, menu items, and event handlers that will perform custom actions. Here
are some ideas:

* Define custom key bindings and menu items that manipulate buffer contents via the extensive
  [`buffer`][] API.
* Extend Textadept's File menu with a menu item that prompts for a commit message using an
  [interactive dialog][], and then invokes a shell command that commits the current file to
  version control using the provided message.
* Listen for the `events.FILE_SAVED` [event][] and [spawn][] an asynchronous process that runs
  a syntax checker, linter, or formatter on a source file when it is saved.
* Start searches with the word under the caret by substituting the "Search > Find" menu item
  and key binding functions with a custom function that pre-populates `ui.find.find_entry_text`
  before calling `ui.find.focus()` to show the find & replace pane.
* Auto-save files as you switch between buffers by listening for the `events.BUFFER_BEFORE_SWITCH`
  event and calling `buffer:save()` for buffers that have a `buffer.filename`. In the GUI version,
  you can even auto-save on a timer via `timeout()`.
* Overload Textadept's find & replace capabilities to use Lua patterns instead of regex by
  reacting to `events.FIND` and `events.REPLACE` before Textadept can, and then determining
  whether or not the editor's default routines should handle those events.

Textadept's [Lua API][] is extensively documented and serves as the ultimate resource when it
comes to scripting the editor. The claim "Textadept gives you complete control over nearly the
entire application using Lua" is not an exaggeration!

If you are looking for a more structured scripting resource, [Textadept Quick Reference][]
contains a wealth of knowledge on how to script and configure Textadept. It groups the editor's
rich API into a series of tasks in a convenient and easy-to-use manner.

#### Generate Autocompletion and Documentation Files

You can generate for use with Textadept [autocompletion and
documentation](#autocompletion-and-documentation) files for your Lua modules. Simply run
[LuaDoc][] with Textadept's *modules/lua/tadoc.lua* doclet. For example:

    cd _HOME
    luadoc -d [output_path] --doclet modules/lua/tadoc [/path/to/module(s)]

where `_HOME` is the path where you installed Textadept and `output_path` is an arbitrary path
to write the generated *tags* and *api* files to. (Note that LuaDoc does not like absolute paths
to doclets, so running `luadoc` from `_HOME` is one way to get it to work.) You can then have
Textadept load and use those autocompletion and documentation files when editing Lua code. For
example, in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    local loaded_tags = false
    events.connect(events.LEXER_LOADED, function(name)
      if name ~= 'lua' or loaded_tags then return end
      _M.lua.tags[#_M.lua.tags + 1] = '/path/to/tags'
      loaded_tags = true
    end)
    table.insert(textadept.editing.api_files.lua, '/path/to/api')

---
### Compiling
---

Textadept is a bit unusual in that building it is only supported on Linux and BSD, or within a
[Docker][] [image][]. The application is cross-compiled for Windows and macOS from Linux. While
it is certainly possible to compile Textadept natively on those platforms, it is simply not
supported in any official capacity.

#### Requirements

The requirements for compiling Textadept on Linux or BSD should be readily available from a
package manager. The requirements for cross-compiling Textadept for Windows from Linux should
also be easily obtainable.

Linux requirements:

* [GNU C compiler][] (*gcc*) 7.1+ (circa mid-2017)
* [GNU Make][] (*make*)
* [GTK][] 3 development libraries for the GUI version (GTK 2.24 is also supported)
* [ncurses][](w) development libraries (wide character support) for the terminal version
* _**OR**_
* [Docker][]

**Note:** on Ubuntu for example, these dependencies would be provided by the `build-essential`,
`libgtk-3-dev` (or `libgtk2.0-dev`), `libncurses-dev`, and `docker.io` packages.

BSD requirements:

* [GNU C compiler][] (*gcc*) 7.1+ or [Clang][] 4.0+
* [GNU Make][] (*gmake*)
* [pkg-config][]
* [libiconv][]
* [GTK][] 3 development libraries for the GUI version (GTK 2.24 is also supported)
* [ncurses][](w) development libraries (wide character support) for the terminal version

Windows cross-compiling requirements:

* [mingw-w64][] 5.0+ with GCC 7.1+
* _**OR**_
* [Docker][]

**Note:** on Ubuntu for example, the compiler dependency would be provided by the `gcc-mingw-w64`
and `g++-mingw-w64` packages.

macOS cross-compiling requirements:

* [OSX cross toolchain][] with [Clang][] 4.0+
* _**OR**_
* [Docker][]

**Note:** Textadept's *src/Dockerfile* contains an example of how to build an OSX cross toolchain.

#### Compiling

Textadept is built from its *src/* directory and binaries are placed in the application's root
directory. The general procedure is to have Textadept build its dependencies first, and then
its binaries. Textadept is self-contained, meaning you do not have to install it; it can run
from its current location.

The following table provides a brief summary of `make` rules for building Textadept on Linux
and BSD. (On BSD, substitute `make` with `gmake`.)

Command | Description
-|-
`make deps` | Downloads and builds all of Textadept's core dependencies
`make deps NIGHTLY=1` | Optionally downloads and builds bleeding-edge dependencies
`make` | Builds Textadept, provided all dependencies are in place
`make GTK2=1` | Builds Textadept using GTK 2.x instead of GTK 3
`make DEBUG=1` | Optionally builds Textadept with debug symbols
`make install` | Optionally installs Textadept (to */usr/local* by default)
`make textadept` | Builds only the GUI version of Textadept
`make curses` | Builds only the terminal version of Textadept
`make curses install`| Optionally installs the terminal version of Textadept
`make uninstall` | Uninstalls Textadept (from */usr/local* by default)
`make clean` | Deletes all compiled files, leaving only source files
`make clean-deps` | Deletes all unpacked dependencies, leaving only downloads
`make win-deps` | Downloads and builds Textadept's Windows dependencies
`make win` | Cross-compiles Textadept for Windows
`make osx-deps` | Downloads and builds Textadept's macOS dependencies
`make osx` | Cross-compiles Textadept for macOS

If you want to install Textadept into a non-standard location, you can specify that location
using the `DESTDIR` variable. For example:

    make install DESTDIR=/prefix/to/install/to

**Linux and BSD note:** if any of Textadept's dependencies are installed under a prefix that your
compiler flags do not include by default (e.g. */usr/local/*), you will have to run something like:

    make CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib"

Also, if you want to compile with Clang, you will have to run something like:

    make CC=cc CXX=c++

##### Compiling using Docker

You can use [Docker][] to build Textadept for Windows, macOS, or Linux. The [image][] required
to do so is about 3GB in size. For example:

    localhost$ docker pull ghcr.io/orbitalquark/textadept-build:v2.0
    localhost$ docker run -t -i -v /path/to/textadept:/ta -w /ta/src \
      ghcr.io/orbitalquark/textadept-build:v2.0
    container# make deps
    container# make
    container# exit

If you prefer to build your own Docker image instead of pulling one, you can run `docker build .`
from Textadept's *src/* directory, which contains the relevant *Dockerfile*.

You can issue within the container any of the build commands given in the previous table,
though the install commands are meaningless.

**Linux note:** if, when running one of the Linux binaries produced, you get an error like
`/<path>/libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_<version>' not found`, then try compiling with the
following flags:

    container# make CXXFLAGS="-0s -std=c++17 -static-libstdc++"

If you still get an error, this time like `/<path>/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_<version>' not
found`, then you will have to compile Textadept manually without Docker.

#### Regex and Lua Pattern Syntax

The following table outlines Regex and Lua Pattern syntax:

Regex | Lua | Meaning
-|-|-
. | . | Matches any character
[[:alpha:]] |%a | Matches any letter
\d | %d | Matches any digit
[[:lower:]] | %l | Matches any lower case character
[[:punct:]] | %p | Matches any punctuation character
\s | %s | Matches any space character
[[:upper:]] | %u | Matches any upper case character
\w | %w | Matches any alphanumeric character (Regex includes '_')
[[:xdigit:]] | %x | Matches any hexadecimal digit
[*set*] | [*set*] | Matches any character in *set*, including ranges like A-Z
[^*set*] | [^*set*] | Matches the complement of *set*
\* | \* | Matches the previous item (Regex) or class (Lua) 0+ times
\+ | + | Matches the previous item or class 1+ times
\*? | - | Matches the previous item or class 0+ times, non-greedily
\+? | | Matches the previous item 1+ times, non-greedily
? | ? | Matches the previous item or class once or not at all
{*m*,*n*} | | Matches the previous item between *m* and *n* times
{*m*,} | | Matches the previous item at least *m* times
{*m*} | | Matches the previous item exactly *m* times
\| | | Matches either the previous item or the next item
&nbsp;  | %b*xy* | Matches a balanced string bounded by *x* and *y*
&nbsp; | %f[*set*] | Matches a position between characters not in and in *set*
\\< | | Matches the beginning of a word
\\> | | Matches the end of a word
\b | | Matches a word boundary
^ | ^ | Matches the beginning of a line unless inside a set
$ | $ | Matches the end of a line unless inside a set
( | ( | The beginning of a captured matching region
) | ) | The end of a captured matching region
(?:*...*) | | Consider matched "*...*" as a single, uncaptured item
\\*n* | %*n* | The *n*th captured matching region's text<sup>a</sup>
\\*x* | %*x* | Non-alphanumeric character *x*, ignoring special meaning

<sup>a</sup>In replacement text, "\0" (Regex) or "%0" (Lua) represents all matched text.

Textadept's regular expressions are based on the C++11 standard for ECMAScript.  There are a
number of references for this syntax on the internet, including:

* [ECMAScript syntax C++ reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/)
* [Modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript)
* [Regular Expressions (C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/regular-expressions-cpp)

More information on Lua patterns can be found in the [Lua 5.3 Reference
Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.1).

#### Terminal Version Compatibility

Textadept's terminal version requires a font with good glyph support (like DejaVu Sans Mono or
Liberation Mono), and lacks some GUI features due to the terminal's constraints:

* No alpha values or transparency.
* No images in autocompletion lists. Instead, autocompletion lists show the first character in
  the string passed to [`buffer.register_image()`][].
* No buffered or two-phase drawing.
* Carets cannot have a period, line style, or width.
* No drag and drop.
* Edge lines may be obscured by text.
* No extra line ascent or descent.
* No fold lines above and below lines.
* No hotspot underlines on mouse hover.
* No indicators other than `INDIC_ROUNDBOX` and `INDIC_STRAIGHTBOX`, although neither has

##### Buffer Indexing Changes

All buffer positions, lines, and countable entities now start from `1` instead of `0`. For example,
`buffer:get_line(1)` now returns the contents of the first line instead of `buffer:get_line(0)`,
and marker and indicator numbers now count from 1 instead of 0.

While this change may seem daunting for migrating user scripts, in practice it is not, since most
usage is internal, and an offset of 1 or 0 does not matter.  In migrating Textadept's internals,
the following changes were made:

* Themes that loop through marker numbers will need to be updated from something like
  `for i = 25, 31 do ... end` to either `for i = 26, 32 do ... end` or
  `for i = buffer.MARKNUM_FOLDEREND, buffer.MARKNUM_FOLDEROPEN do ... end`.
* Most references of `buffer.length` will need to be changed to `buffer.length + 1`. For example,
  something like `buffer:goto_pos(buffer.length)` needs to be `buffer:goto_pos(buffer.length + 1)`.
  The exceptions are when `buffer.length` is not used as a position, as in
  `buffer:indicator_clear_range(1, buffer.length)`, which is still valid.
* Any `buffer` function calls and property indexing with bare numbers should be changed to
  calls or indexes with those numbers plus 1. For example, `buffer:contracted_fold_next(0)`
  changes to `buffer:contracted_fold_next(1)`, and `buffer.margin_n_width[1] = ...` changes to
  `buffer.margin_n_width[2] = ...`.
* Any looping through lines, margins, and selections via
  `for i = 0, buffer.{line_count,margins,selections} - 1 do ... end` needs to be
  `for i = 1, buffer.{line_count,margins,selections} do ... end`.
* Similarly, any language modules that loop back through lines (e.g. to determine types for
  autocompletion) via `for i = current_line, 0, -1 do ... end` needs to be
  `for i = current_line, 1, -1 do ... end`.
* Marker or indicator masks are produced by subtracting 1 from marker or indicator
  numbers. For example, `1 << textadept.bookmarks.MARK_BOOKMARK` changes to
  `1 << textadept.bookmarks.MARK_BOOKMARK - 1`.
* Logic that depends on the return value of `buffer:get_cur_line()` may need to be changed. For
  example, any subsequent references to `pos` after `local line, pos = buffer:get_cur_line()`
  like `if line:sub(1, pos) ... end` need to be changed to `if line:sub(1, pos - 1) ... end`.

I found it helpful to quickly scan source files for syntax-highlighted numbers and then seeing
if those numbers needed to be changed. Searching for "- 1", "+ 1", "buffer.length", etc. was
also helpful.

##### View API Additions and Buffer API Changes

Textadept's [buffer][] API is largely based on the [Scintilla API][], which does not distinguish
between buffer- and view-specific functionality. Textadept 11 now attempts to separate this
functionality, but only superficially. Buffers and views may be used interchangeably for the
most part, but the [buffer][] and [view][] API provides _guidance_ (not hard requirements)
on which functions and fields are more appropriate for their respective objects. _User scripts
do not need to be updated and will continue to function normally_. The following "Find" regex
can be used to help convert `buffer.*` functionality to `view.*`:

##### Theme and Lexer Changes

Themes and lexers have a new, optional API for defining and using colors and styles. Previously,
all definitions and access to colors and styles was accomplished through `buffer.property`
and `buffer.property_int`. Now it can be done via the `lexer.colors` and `lexer.styles`
variables. For example:

    -- Textadept 10
    local property, property_int = buffer.property, buffer.property_int
    property['color.blue'] = 0xFF0000
    property['style.keyword'] = 'fore:$(color.blue),bold'
    buffer.edge_colour = property_int['color.grey']

    -- Textadept 11
    local colors, styles = lexer.colors, lexer.styles
    colors.blue = 0xFF0000
    styles.keyword = {fore = colors.blue, bold = true}
    view.edge_color = colors.grey

Any additional settings passed `view:set_theme()` are available as global variables in the
theme. Textadept's themes make use of `font` and `size` (the latter of which used to be
`fontsize`) for easily configuring font and size per-user.

Lexers can also utilize these new features. For example:

    -- Textadept 10
    lex:add_rule('custom_rule', token('custom', P('word')))
    lex:add_style('custom', lexer.STYLE_KEYWORD .. 'italic')

    -- Textadept 11
    lex:add_rule('custom_rule', token('custom', P('word')))
    lex:add_style('custom', lexer.styles.keyword .. {italic = true})

Note that these features are optional. Themes and lexers setting property strings is still
supported.

##### Localization Changes

GUI mnemonics in localization keys have been removed. For example, `_L['_New']` should be
changed to `_L['New']`. Mnemonics can still be used in localization values; it's just the keys
that have changed. See Textadept's *core/locale.conf* for examples.

##### Key Bindings Changes

Key sequence modifiers have changed from their shortened form to a longer form that is more
intuitive. `'c'` is now `'ctrl'`, `'a'` is now `'alt'`, `'m'` is now `'cmd'` on macOS and
`'meta'` in the terminal version, and `'s'` is now `'shift'`. For example, `keys.cn = ...` is now
`keys['ctrl+n'] = ...` and `keys['m<'] = ...` is now `keys['cmd+<'] = ...` or `keys['meta+<']
= ...`.

The key binding for inserting a user-specified snippet from a dialog has changed from `Ctrl+K`
(`⌥⇥` on macOS | `M-K` on the terminal) to `Ctrl+Shift+K` (`⌥⇧⇥` | `M-S-K`). `Ctrl+K`
(`⌥⇥` | `M-K`) now autocompletes snippet names.

##### Session Changes

Textadept saves and loads session from Lua data files instead of structured text files. As a
result, Textadept 11 cannot load session files from 10.x or before.

##### Miscellaneous Changes

* *~/.textadept/?.lua* and *~/.textadept/?.{so,dll}* has been removed from `package.path` and
  `package.cpath`, respectively. All modules should be placed in *~/.textadept/modules/*.
* The command entry no longer recognizes a Lua 5.1-style '`=`' prefix for printing return
  values. Printing return values has been the default for quite some time.
